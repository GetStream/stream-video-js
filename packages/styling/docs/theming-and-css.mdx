## Theming and CSS

Our SDK comes with built-in UI components that enable creating a fully functioning video application without any custom components. However, our built-in UI components have minimal customization options (you can find these options below). This limitation is by design. We believe that the complexity of our SDK doesn't come from the UI components, so we didn't create a complex customization system for them that you have to understand and learn how to use with your own UI library/design system. If some of our built-in components don't suit your needs, you should feel free to create your own UI component(s).

### Usage

If you want to use one or more UI components provided by the SDK, you'll have to import the stylesheet of the SDK. You can import the stylesheet either as a **CSS** file or as an **SCSS** file.

#### React SDK

Add one of the following code snippets to your project:

```css
TODO import statement
```

```scss
TODO import statement
```

#### Angular SDK

Add one of the following code snippets to your project:

```css
TODO import statement
```

```scss
TODO import statement
```

### Theming

You can customize the **colors**, **border-radius settings**, and **icons** used by the built-in UI components.

Customizing can be done using **CSS variables** defined in our [variables file](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/blob/main/packages/styling/src/_Variables.scss).

### Responsive layout

All components provided by the SDK are responsive by design. However, the SDK doesn't offer a separate layout for mobile devices. For example, if you want to change the call layout on mobile devices (for example, use four columns on desktop screens and two on mobile screens), you'll have to do this by [custom CSS](#customcss) or by creating your own custom component.

### Custom CSS

If you want to tweak the layout/design of a built-in component, it's often easier to write a few lines of CSS code than to create your own custom component. However, please note that the HTML/CSS structure of the UI components can change with any new release (even with patch releases), so you should test if your custom CSS codes are still working with each SDK update.

If a UI component needs a bigger tweak, we suggest creating your own component instead.
