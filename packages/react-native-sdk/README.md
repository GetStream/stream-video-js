## **What is Stream?**

Stream allows developers to rapidly deploy scalable feeds, chat messaging and video with an industry leading 99.999% uptime SLA guarantee.

With Stream's video components, you can use their SDK to build in-app video calling, audio rooms, audio calls, or live streaming. The best place to get started is with their tutorials:

- [Video & Audio Calling Tutorial](https://getstream.io/video/docs/reactnative/tutorials/video-calling/)
- [Audio Rooms Tutorial](https://getstream.io/video/docs/reactnative/tutorials/audio-room/)
- [Livestreaming Tutorial](https://getstream.io/video/docs/reactnative/tutorials/livestream/)

Stream provides UI components and state handling that make it easy to build video calling for your app. All calls run on Stream's network of edge servers around the world, ensuring optimal latency and reliability.

## **Repo Overview** üòé

This repo contains projects and samples developed by the team and Stream community.
Projects are broken up into directories containing the source code for each project.

## **Projects/Packages üöÄ**

The React Native SDK is a part of the Stream Video JS monorepo.
The monorepo consists of multiple folders, the most important of which are `packages` and `sample-apps`.

- The `packages` folder contains the packages each of which is a separate npm package. The React Native SDK is one of the packages alongside:
  - [Our shared JS Call Engine](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/tree/main/packages/client) (`client`).
  - [React Bindings](../react-bindings) (`react-bindings`).
  - [React SDK](../react-sdk#official-react-sdk-for-stream-video) (`react-sdk`).
- The `sample-apps` folder contains the sample apps that are built using the packages from the `packages` folder.
  React Native's most relevant sample app is the `dogfooding` app which is a complete app that implements most of the features of the SDK.

- The `react-native-sdk/docusaurus` folder contains the documentation and guides.

## **Requirements** üõ†

Before running this project please ensure you have set up your [development environment for React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
The Stream Video React Native SDK supports apps created with the React Native CLI.

## **Contributing** ü§ù

- How can I submit a sample app?
  - Apps submissions are always welcomed ü•≥ Open a pr with a proper description and we'll review it as soon as possible
- Spot a bug üï∑ ?
  - We welcome code changes that improve the apps or fix a problem. Please make sure to follow all best practices and add tests if applicable before submitting a Pull Request on Github.
