The [Stream Video React Native SDK](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js) enables you to easily build any type of Video and Audio call experiences in your React Native apps.

> **Note**: The fastest way to get started with the SDK is by trying the [Video Tutorial](01-tutorial.mdx). You'll learn everything about setting up the SDK and starting a video call with other people there.

The **Basics** section provides an overview of the SDK and shows you how to get started with building call features.

The **Guides** section provides high-level overview of the most important concepts you need to know for building your application.

The **Video UI components** section describes the ready-to-use components provided by the SDK.

The **Call Engine** section provides a detailed description of our state management, lists all the available API operations and utility functions/hooks/contexts.

The **Advanced Guides** and **UI Cookbook** sections help you with various customization aspects.
