Push notifications can be configured to receive updates when the application is closed or on the background. Stream Video Server sends push notification for Ringing calls and Live calls that are about to start to users that have at least one registered device.

To receive push notifications from Stream Video Server, you'll need to:

1. Configure your push notification provider on the [Stream Dashboard](https://dashboard.getstream.io).
2. Add the native setup for both iOS and Android.
3. Setup the push config for the SDK.
