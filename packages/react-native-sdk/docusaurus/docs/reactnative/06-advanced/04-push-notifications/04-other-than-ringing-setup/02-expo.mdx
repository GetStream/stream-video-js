This guide discusses how to set up your Expo app to get push notifications from Stream for the non-ringing calls that your user will receive.

## Add push provider credentials to Stream

Please follow the below guides for adding appropriate push providers to Stream:

- Android - [Firebase Cloud Messaging](../../push-providers/firebase/)
- iOS - [Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)](../../push-providers/apn-voip/)

## Install Dependencies

```bash title=Terminal
npx expo install expo-notifications
npx expo install expo-task-manager
```

So what did we install precisely?

- `expo-notifications` and `expo-task-manager` for handling incoming [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) notifications on Android and iOS.

## Add Firebase credentials

1. To create a Firebase project, go to the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and click on **Add project**.

2. In the console, click the setting icon next to **Project overview** and open **Project settings**. Then, under **Your apps**, click the Android icon to open **Add Firebase to your Android app** and follow the steps. **Make sure that the Android package name you enter is the same as the value of** `android.package` **from your app.json.**

3. After registering the app, download the **google-services.json** file and place it in your project's root directory.

4. In **app.json**, add an `android.googleServicesFile` field with the relative path to the downloaded **google-services.json** file. If you placed it in the root directory, the path is:

```js title="app.json"
{
  "android": {
    "googleServicesFile": "./google-services.json"
  }
}
```

:::note

The **google-services.json** file contains unique and non-secret identifiers of your Firebase project. For more information, see [Understand Firebase Projects](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more#config-files-objects).

:::
## Add the Config Plugin property

In **app.json**, in the `plugins` field, add true to the `enableNonRingingPushNotifications` property in the `@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk` plugin.

```js title="app.json"
{
 "plugins": [
      [
        "@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk",
        {
          // highlight-next-line
           "enableNonRingingPushNotifications": true
        }
      ],
      // your other plugins
  ]
}
```

## Setup the push config for the SDK

The SDK automatically processes the non ringing call push notifications once the setup above is done if the push config has been set using `StreamVideoRN.setPushConfig`. To do this follow the steps below,

### Add the ability to statically navigate to screens in your app

When a user taps on the push notification and the JS engine is not ready, they should still be able to navigate to the screen that shows the active call. You can achieve this by using [imperative navigation in the expo router](https://docs.expo.dev/routing/navigating-pages/#imperative-navigation).

The following is an example implementation of a utility file that has helpers to statically navigate in the app:

```ts title="src/utils/staticNavigation.ts"
import { User } from '@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk';
import { router } from 'expo-router';

/**
 * This is used to run the navigation logic from root level
 */
export const staticNavigateToActiveCall = () => {
  const intervalId = setInterval(async () => {
    // add any requirements here (like authentication)
    if (GlobalState.hasAuthentication) {
      clearInterval(intervalId);
      router.push('/activecall');
    }
  }, 300);
};

export const staticNavigateToLivestreamCall = () => {
  const intervalId = setInterval(async () => {
    // add any requirements here (like authentication)
    if (GlobalState.hasAuthentication) {
      clearInterval(intervalId);
      router.push('/livestream');
    }
  }, 300);
};
```

### Setup the push config

Once we have set up the methods to navigate the app from a static method we are ready to call the `StreamVideoRN.setPushConfig` method. Below is an example of how this method can be called,

```ts title="src/utils/setPushConfig.ts"
import {
  StreamVideoClient,
  StreamVideoRN,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk';
import { AndroidImportance } from '@notifee/react-native';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
import { STREAM_API_KEY } from '../../constants';
import { staticNavigateToRingingCall, staticNavigateToLivestreamCall } from './staticNavigationUtils';

export function setPushConfig() {
  StreamVideoRN.setPushConfig({
    // pass true to inform the SDK that this is an expo app
    isExpo: true,
    ios: {
      // add your push_provider_name for iOS that you have setup in Stream dashboard
      pushProviderName: __DEV__ ? 'apn-video-staging' : 'apn-video-production',
    },
    android: {
      // add your push_provider_name for Android that you have setup in Stream dashboard
      pushProviderName: __DEV__
        ? 'firebase-video-staging'
        : 'firebase-video-production',
      // configure the notification channel to be used for non ringing calls for Android.
      callChannel: {
        id: 'stream_call_notifications',
        name: 'Call notifications',
        // This importance will ensure that the notification will appear on-top-of applications.
        importance: AndroidImportance.HIGH,
        sound: "default",
      },
      // configure the functions to create the texts shown in the notification
      // for non ringing calls in Android.
      callNotificationTextGetters: {
        getTitle(type, createdUserName) {
          if (type === 'call.live_started') {
            return `Call went live, it was started by ${createdUserName}`;
          } else {
            return `${createdUserName} is notifying you about a call`;
          }
        },
        getBody(_type, createdUserName) {
          return 'Tap to open the call';
        },
      },
    },
    // optional: add the callback to be executed when a non ringing call notification is tapped
    onTapNonRingingCallNotification: () => {
      const [callType, callId] = call_cid.split(':');
      if (callType === 'livestream') {
        staticNavigateToLivestreamCall();
      } else {
        staticNavigateToActiveCall();
      }
    },
    // add the async callback to create a video client
    // for incoming calls in the background on a push notification
    createStreamVideoClient: async () => {
      // note that since the method is async,
      // you can call your server to get the user data or token or retrieve from offline storage.
      const userId = await AsyncStorage.getItem('@userId');
      const userName = await AsyncStorage.getItem('@userName');
      const token = await AsyncStorage.getItem('@userToken');
      if (!username || !userToken) return undefined;
      const user = { id: userId, name: userName, token };
      return new StreamVideoClient({
        apiKey: STREAM_API_KEY, // pass your stream api key
        user,
        token,
      });
    },
  });
}
```

Now, call the method outside of your application cycle. That is inside `index.js`. This is because the app can be opened from a dead state through a push notification and in that case, we need to use the config as soon as the JS bridge is initialized. Following is an example,

```js title="index.js"
import 'expo-router/entry';
import { setPushConfig } from './utils/setPushConfig';

setPushConfig();
```

## Request for notification permissions

At an appropriate place in your app, request for notification permissions from the user. Below is a small example of how to request permissions in Expo:

```js
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';
await Notifications.requestPermissionsAsync();
```

## Disabling push - usually on logout

In some cases you would want to disable push from happening. For example, if user logs out of your app. Or if the user switches. You can disable push like below:

```js
import { StreamVideoRN } from '@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk';

StreamVideoRN.onPushLogout();
```

## Troubleshooting

- During development, you may be facing a situation where push notification is shown but its events like accepting or rejecting a call don't work. This is because, during hot module reloading the global event listeners may get de-registered. To properly test during development, make sure that you fully restart the app or test in release mode without the metro packager.
- You can check the "Webhook & Push Logs" section in the [Stream Dashboard](https://dashboard.getstream.io/) to see if Notifications were sent by Stream.
- If you are still having trouble with Push Notifications, please submit a ticket to us at [support](https://getstream.io/contact/support/).
