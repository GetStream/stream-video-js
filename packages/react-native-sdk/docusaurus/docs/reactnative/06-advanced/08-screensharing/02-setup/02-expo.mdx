title: Expo Screen Sharing Setup
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

In this document, we explain how to setup screen share for Android and iOS in your Expo App.

In **app.json**, in the `plugins` field, add the `enableScreenshare` property and `appleTeamId` property to the `@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk` plugin.

```js title="app.json"
{
 "plugins": [
      [
        "@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk",
        {
          // highlight-start
          "enableScreenshare": true,
          "appleTeamId": <ADD-YOUR-APPLE-TEAM-ID>, // example: "EHV7XZLAHA"
          // highlight-end
          // .. rest
        }
      ],
  ]
}
```

:::note

- The `appleTeamId` field is used for signing the new extension created for screen share.

:::

The above configuration in the plugin will generate a new screen sharing extension named as "broadcast" and adds relevant information to your iOS app target as well.
