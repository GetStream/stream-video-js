description: Approaches to broadcasting & RTMP
---

Broadcasting serves as a means of transmitting live or pre-recorded content to a wide audience.

We can choose from two approaches to broadcasting the media:

1. [HLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) - slight delay, better buffering
2. [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) - lower latency, less reliability

It is up to the integrators to decide, what approach will be used in their apps for the audience to consume the streams.

:::tip
We have built a [livestream app tutorial](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/reactnative/tutorial/livestreaming/) that relies on the broadcasting feature. The demo expands on how to implement both, the HLS and the WebRTC approach to streaming.

## Call type for broadcasting

Stream infrastructure recognizes few pre-built call types. Among them, the type [`livestream` type](../../core/configuring-call-types#livestream) is the best suited for broadcasting events. When a `livestream` call is created, it is set to `backstage` mode by default. The `backstage` mode makes it easy to build a flow where hosts can set up cameras and equipment before going live.

## Starting and stopping the broadcasting

We have the following `Call` methods at our disposal to start and stop the broadcasting:

```ts
await call.startHLS();
await call.stopHLS();
```

alternatively:

```ts
await call.goLive({ start_hls: true });
```

Once started broadcasting, the data source URL is available through `playlist_url` property accessible through the `Call` state:

```ts
import { useCallStateHooks } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

// omitted code ...

const YourComponent = () => {
  const { useCallEgress } = useCallStateHooks();
  const egress = useCallEgress();
  const m3u8Playlist = egress?.hls.playlist_url;

  // omitted code ...
};
```

To play the video over HLS, a third-party library is required (for example [React Native Video](https://github.com/react-native-video/react-native-video)).

## Broadcasting via RTMP

Our systems provide first-class support for streaming from RTMP clients as [OBS](https://obsproject.com/).
To connect your OBS project in a Stream Call, please follow the next steps:

### RTMP URL and stream key

Our `call` instance exposes its RTMP address through `call.state.ingress` and `useCallIngress()` call state hook.
`Stream Key` in our case is a standard [user token](../../guides/client-auth/#generating-a-token).

You can take this information and use it to configure OBS:

```typescript
import { useCallStateHooks } from '@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk';

const { useCallIngress } = useCallStateHooks();
const ingress = useCallIngress();

const rtmpURL = ingress?.rtmp.address;
const streamKey = myUserAuthService.getUserToken(rtmpUserId);

console.log('RTMP url:', rtmpURL, 'Stream key:', streamKey);
```

### Configure OBS

- Go to Settings > Stream
- Select `custom` service
- Server: enter the `rtmpURL` logged in the console
- Stream Key: enter the `streamKey` logged in the console

Press `Start Streaming` in OBS and the RTMP stream will now show up in your call just like a regular video participant.
