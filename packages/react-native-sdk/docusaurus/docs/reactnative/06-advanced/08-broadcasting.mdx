[//]: # (Broadcasting serves as a means of transmitting live or pre-recorded content to a wide audience.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (We can choose from two approaches to broadcasting the media:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (1. [HLS]&#40;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming&#41; - slight delay, better buffering)

[//]: # (2. [WebRTC]&#40;https://webrtc.org/&#41; - lower latency, less reliability)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (It is up to the integrators to decide, what approach will be used in their apps for the audience to consume the streams.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (:::tip)

[//]: # (We have built a [livestream app tutorial]&#40;../../tutorials/livestream&#41; that relies on the broadcasting feature. The demo expands on how to implement both, the HLS and the WebRTC approach to streaming.)

[//]: # (:::)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (## Call type for broadcasting)

[//]: # (Stream infrastructure recognizes few pre-built call types. Among them, the type [`livestream` type]&#40;../../guides/configuring-call-types#livestream&#41; is the best suited for broadcasting events. When a `livestream` call is created, it is set to `backstage` mode by default.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (## Starting and stopping the broadcasting)

[//]: # (We have the following `Call` methods at our disposal to start and stop the broadcasting:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```ts)

[//]: # (call.startBroadcasting&#40;&#41;)

[//]: # (call.stopBroadcasting&#40;&#41;)

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # (Once started broadcasting, the data source URL is available through `playlist_url` property accessible through the `Call` state:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```ts)

[//]: # (import { useCallMetadata } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (// omitted code ...)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (const YourComponent = &#40;&#41; => {)

[//]: # (  const metadata = useCallMetadata&#40;&#41;;)

[//]: # (  const { playlist_url } = metadata.egress.hls;)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (  // omitted code ...)

[//]: # (})

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (To play the video over HLS, a third-party library is required &#40;for example [HLS.js]&#40;https://nochev.github.io/hls.js/docs/html/&#41;&#41;.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (:::important)

[//]: # (In order the data to be broadcasted to the participants, the host side has to invoke `call.goLive&#40;&#41;` alongisde `call.startBroadcasting&#40;&#41;`.)
