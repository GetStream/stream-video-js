### Call's recording features

In some cases, you want to be able to record a meeting and share the recording with the participants later on. The Stream Video React Native SDK has support for this use-case.

To support this feature, you will need to use the `Call`'s recording features, available after you join a call.

#### Recording state

To determine, whether a call recording is in progress, we use `useIsCallRecordingInProgress` hook. This may serve us well, when we want to provide visual clues about the recording state. We have to be aware, that it can take few moments until a call recording starts. We recommend to keep your own state signalling that the call recording is starting, but has not begun yet.

```ts
const isCallRecordingInProgress = useIsCallRecordingInProgress();
```

#### Start or Stop a recording

To start recording, we simply invoke `call.startRecording()`. To stop recording, we use `call.stopRecording()`:

```ts
await call.startRecording() // to start recording
await call.stopRecording() // to stop recording
``` 

Starting and stopping will update the state in the `useIsCallRecordingInProgress` hook.

#### Stop a recording

To stop a recording, you need to call the `stopRecording` method of the `Call`:

```swift
func stopRecording() {
    Task {
        try await call.stopRecording()
    }
}
```

This will change the current recording state of the call to `noRecording`.

#### Recording events

You can listen to the recording events and show visual indications to the users based on these events, by subscribing to the async stream of the `recordingEvents`:

```swift
func subscribeToRecordingEvents() {
    Task {
        for await event in call.subscribe() {
            switch event {
                case .typeCallRecordingStartedEvent(let recordingStartedEvent):
                    log.debug("received an event \(recordingStartedEvent)")
                    /* handle recording event */
                case .typeCallRecordingStoppedEvent(let recordingStoppedEvent):
                    log.debug("received an event \(recordingStoppedEvent)")
                    /* handle recording event */
                default:
                    break
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Search recordings

You can search for recordings in a video call, using the `Call`'s `listRecordings` method:

```swift
func loadRecordings() {
    Task {
        self.recordings = try await call.listRecordings()
    }
}
```

This will return a list of recordings, that contains information about the filename, URL, as well as the start and end time. You can use the URL to present the recording in a player. Here's an example in SwiftUI:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import StreamVideo
import AVKit

struct PlayerView: View {
    
    let recording: CallRecordingInfo
    
    var body: some View {
        Group {
            if let url = URL(string: recording.url) {
                VideoPlayer(player: AVPlayer(url:  url))
            } else {
                Text("Video can't be loaded")
            }
        }
    }
}
```
