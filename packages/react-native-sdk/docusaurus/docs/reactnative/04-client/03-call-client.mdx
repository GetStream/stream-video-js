## CallClient

Once the user joins a call through `StreamVideo` and its `joinCall` and similar functions, you'll receive a `JoinedCall`. It contains several pieces of information required to create a `CallClient` and fully connect to a `Call`.

You can create the client like so:

`[//]: # (todo: add code snippet)


You should create the `CallClient` as soon as you join a call through `StreamVideo`, or as soon as your users are ready to fully connect, based on your use case. After creating the client, it connects to the underlying WebSocket to listen to events from the server, which you can read more about in the [socket events guide](../02-guides/04-socket-events.mdx).

## Functionality

Once you create it, you can use its functionality that falls into three small groups:

* Call state management
* Media device handling
* Socket events

Let's explore what this API allows you to do.

### Call state management

Here are the main functions which let you control the state of a call:

`[//]: # (todo: add code snippet)

### Media Device Handling

When it comes to device handling we offer the following functionality:

`[//]: # (todo: add code snippet)

### Socket Events

Similar to the `StreamVideo` client, the `CallClient` has its own WebSocket connection and set of events that you can consume using the following API:

[//]: # (todo: add code snippet)

* `addSocketListener`: Adds a listener instance that will receive all the Call socket events. You can learn more about them in the [socket events guide](../02-guides/04-socket-events.mdx).
* `removeSocketListener`: Removes an active listener instance to free up memory or stop receiving events.
