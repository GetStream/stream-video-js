This is the main part of our SDK and it needs to be initialized with a user and a token. We require this as it doesn't make much sense to start our client without the user present.

To initialize it, you can do the following:

`[//]: # (todo: add code snippet)

Once you create `StreamVideo`, it also creates a WebSocket connection that listens to different events from the server. If you want to learn more about it, read through our [socket events guide](../04-guides/03-socket-events.mdx).

## Functionality

`StreamVideo` exposes a few groups of functionality that you can use to build your use case:

* Call CRUD operations
* Event handling
* Call State & Management

All of these functions are exposed within `StreamVideo`, but it's easier to explore them in an intuitive way. Let's see what each group allows you to do.

### Call Crud operations

`[//]: # (todo: add code snippet)

### Event Handling

If you're interested in listening to events that we provide through the underlying WebSocket, as well as sending events yourself, you can use the following API:

`[//]: # (todo: add code snippet)


The final group of functionality is related to active calls.

### Call State & Management

Once you set up a call either by creating a new one or joining an existing, you can access and manage its state through `StreamVideo`:

`[//]: # (todo: add code snippet)
