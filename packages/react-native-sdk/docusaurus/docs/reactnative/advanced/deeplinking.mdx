## Implementing Call Deep Linking

One of the features Stream Video provides is the ability to deep link into a call directly, using only the call ID.

Our API makes it very easy to integrate and start your custom UI, or our existing screens.

> **Note**: This guide expects that you've set up a custom Application that has ways to initialize our SDK with a given user. If you want to learn more about this, check our [Basics](TODO) set of pages on ways how to do so.

<Tabs
  defaultValue='android'
  values={[
    { label: 'Android', value: 'android' },
    { label: 'iOS', value: 'ios' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value='android'>

For instructions on how to add support for deep linking on Android we will primarily follow [this guide](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking#adding-filters).

To create a link to your app content, add an intent filter that contains these elements and attribute values in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file at `/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.

- `action` - Specify the ACTION_VIEW intent action so that the intent filter can be reached from Google Search.

```xml
<action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
```

- `data` - Add one or more `<data>` tags, each of which represents a URI format that resolves to the activity. At minimum, the `<data>` tag must include the `android:scheme` attribute.

```xml
<data android:scheme="http" />
<data android:scheme="https" />
<data android:host="`YOUR URL HERE`" />
```

- `category` - Include the `DEFAULT` and the `BROWSABLE` category. It is required in order for the intent filter to be accessible from a web browser. Without it, clicking a link in a browser cannot resolve to your app.

```xml
<category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
<category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
```

Combined together your intent filter should look like:

```xml
<intent-filter android:autoVerify="true">
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="http" />
    <data android:scheme="https" />
    <!-- Example: "https://stream-calls-dogfood.vercel.app” -->
    <data android:host="`YOUR URL HERE`" />
</intent-filter>
```

An Android App Link is a special type of deep link that allows your website URLs to immediately open the corresponding content in your Android app, without requiring the user to select the app.
Android App Links use the [Digital Asset Links API](https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links) to establish trust that your app has been approved by the website to automatically open links for that domain. If the system successfully verifies that you own the URLs, the system automatically routes those URL intents to your app.

To verify that you own both your app and the website URLs, complete the following steps:

- Add intent filters that contain the `autoVerify` attribute(as we have done in our example above). This attribute signals to the system that it should verify whether your app belongs to the URL domains used in your intent filters.

- [Declare the association](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-android-applinks#web-assoc) between your website and your intent filters by hosting a Digital Asset Links JSON file at the following location:

```
https://domain.name/.well-known/assetlinks.json
```

:::note

If you have a React project, the `.well-known/assetlinks.json` should go inside your `public` directory of the project.

:::

You can use [this tool](https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/tools/generator) to generate the `assetlink.json` for your web project. Enter the Hosting site name, App package name and App package fingerprint(SHA256) to generate it.

- Hosting site name is the url of the website which we will use for deep linking in our app.
- App package name can be easily found in the first line of your `MainActivity.java` file as a value to `package`.
- There are two ways to get your App package fingerprint(SHA256).

  1. If you have already uploaded your app to Play store then go to Google Play Console > Release management > App signing.
  2. If you haven't uploaded your app to Play store, then run the following command in your terminal. You have to replace `<keystore path>`, `<key alias>`, `<store password>`, `<key password>` with your values.

  ```bash
  keytool -list -v -keystore <keystore path> -alias <key alias> -storepass <store password> -keypass <key password>
  ```
