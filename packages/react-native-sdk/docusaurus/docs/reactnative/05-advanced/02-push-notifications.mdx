## Implement Stream Push Notification Providers

Thanks to our existing PN system, it's very easy to integrate push notification handling within your Chat and Video apps.

Additionally, for Video, we support notifications when engaging in **ringing calls**, where you can accept or decline calls with just a click of a button. This behavior is included in the `stream-video-react-native` dependency, so you don't have to add any other artifacts to your project.

There are only a few smaller steps to integrate push notifications with Stream Video. Let's see how.

You can see the **Accept** and **Reject** buttons, which you can use to trigger the respective call actions.

In case your users are on the lock screen and they receive an incoming call notification, it should show the `IncomingCall` UI, like so:

It shows the information about who's calling you and gives you the options to reject or accept a call, as well as change the initial video state.
