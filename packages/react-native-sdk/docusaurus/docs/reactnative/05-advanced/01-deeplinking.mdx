## Implementing Call Deep Linking

One of the features Stream Video provides is the ability to deep link into a call directly, using only the call ID.

Our API makes it very easy to integrate and start your custom UI, or our existing screens.

> **Note**: This guide expects that you've set up a custom Application that has ways to initialize our SDK with a given user. If you want to learn more about this, check our [Basics](TODO) set of pages on ways how to do so.

To get started, you first need to create an `Activity` that'll parse the deep link URL and consume the data. Here's an example of a simple `Activity` that does this:

[//]: # (TODO: Write guide)

Finally, run your application and either manually generate a call link using the schema above or use our Web API. Once you have that ready, send it to your phone and try opening the link, it should automatically redirect to your app and open the call.

// TODO - add a GIF of how this behavior works
