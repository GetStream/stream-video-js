### Troubleshooting

#### Error: Super expression must either be null or a function

<EventTargetShimWorkaround isExpo={props.isExpo} />

**Reference**: https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-webrtc/issues/1503

#### Android Only Error: Could not find any matches for app.notifee:core:+ as no versions of app.notifee:core are available.

<NotifeeWorkaround isExpo={props.isExpo} />

#### Android Only Error: One of receiver_exported or receiver_not_exported

This occurs due to having `targetSdk 34` in Android. This is a [known issue in `react-native-incall-manager`](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-incall-manager/issues/235) library. You can temporarily workaround this by downgrading your `targetSdk` to `33` until this issue is resolved.
