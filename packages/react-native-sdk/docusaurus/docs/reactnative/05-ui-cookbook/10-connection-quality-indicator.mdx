Network conditions are not always perfect so instead of playing guessing games as to why is someone's video so blurry our default [`ParticipantView`](../../ui-components/participants/participant-view/) component comes equipped with connection quality indicator which provides general information about that participants network conditions in four states:

- UNSPECIFIED
- POOR
- GOOD
- EXCELLENT

In this guide we'll learn how to build and implement our own primitive connection quality indicator.

## How to reach the state

Each [`StreamVideoParticipant`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/blob/main/packages/client/src/types.ts) has a `connectionQuality` property which by itself is just a numeric representation of values in a `SfuModels.ConnectionQuality` enumerator. To get a readable format out of it we'll just pass the `connectionQuality` variable as a key to said enumerator:

```tsx
import { SfuModels } from '@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk';

const readableConnectionQuality =
  SfuModels.ConnectionQuality[participant.connectionQuality];

console.log(readableConnectionQuality); // -> EXCELLENT
```

## Connection quality indicator component

You'll most likely be displaying this indicator component inside each participant view ([ParticipantView](../../ui-components/core/participant-view)) within a call layout, you can learn more about `ParticipantView` customizations in [the participant view customizations guide](../participant-view-customizations).

```tsx
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
import {
  SfuModels,
  StreamVideoParticipant,
  StreamVideoLocalParticipant,
  useParticipants,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk';
import participant from '@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk/dist/__tests__/mocks/participant';

const ConnectionQualityIndicator = ({
  participant,
}: {
  participant: StreamVideoParticipant | StreamVideoLocalParticipant;
}) => {
  const readableConnectionQuality =
    SfuModels.ConnectionQuality[participant.connectionQuality];

  return (
    <Text>
      {`${readableConnectionQuality} -
      ${'⭐️'.repeat(participant.connectionQuality)}`}
    </Text>
  );
};

const CustomParticipantViewUI = ({
  participant,
}: {
  participant: StreamVideoParticipant | StreamVideoLocalParticipant;
}) => {
  return (
    <>
      <ConnectionQualityIndicator participant={participant} />
      {/* your other custom UI elements */}
    </>
  );
};

const ParticipantView = () => {
  const participants = useParticipants();

  return (
    <View>
      {participants.map((participant) => {
        // Code for your custom participant view
        return (
          <View>
            {/* ParticipantLabel is rendered as a sub component here */}
            <CustomParticipantViewUI participant={participant} />
          </View>
        );
      })}
    </View>
  );
};
```
