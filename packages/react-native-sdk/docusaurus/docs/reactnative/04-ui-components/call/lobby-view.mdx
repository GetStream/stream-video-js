LobbyView is a component that is designed to make your entrance and invite experience to a meeting call user-friendly. The purpose is to allow users to test their setup before entering the meeting call. This component mainly contains all the necessary information about the meeting, including:

- The call details such as its id, etc.
- Participants who are already in the meeting.
- Controlling the audio/video mute status before joining the meeting.
- Exposes a handler for the join meeting button.

  const onCallJoinHandler = useCallback(async () => {
    try {
      // Handle what should happen before joining the call. Eg: showing loader, etc.
      await call?.join({ create: true });
      // Handle what should happen after the call is joined. Eg: navigation, etc.
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle the case when there is an error while joining the call
