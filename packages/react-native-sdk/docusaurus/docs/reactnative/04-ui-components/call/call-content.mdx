The `CallContent` is the highest-level UI component that allows you to build your own call screen with full UI elements. So you don't need to take care much about each feature that you need to build a video call screen with this component.

Basically what you can do with the `CallContent` is:

- A full call screen with multiple UI elements, such as the top view, participants grid, and control action buttons.
- Handles the state and actions of enabling and disabling camera, microphone, and speakerphone.
- Renders screen sharing.
- Display participant information, such as network quality, name, microphone states, and reactions.
- Renders video of the participant.
- Allows changing layout from `grid` to `spotlight`.

Based on the call state, the CallContent provides a list or grid of participants, with their avatars and names, or a video if they're publishing, with more information for each participant, like their connection quality, etc.

<ImageShowcase
  items={[
    {
      image: CallContentGrid,
      caption: 'Call Content Grid',
      alt: 'Call Content Grid',
    },
    {
      image: CallContentSpotlight,
      caption: 'Call Content Spotlight',
      alt: 'Call Content Spotlight',
    },
  ]}
/>

## General usage

Let's see how to show the `CallContent` UI:

```tsx {13}
import {
  Call,
  CallContent,
  StreamCall,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk';

const VideoCallUI = () => {
  let call: Call;
  // your logic to create a new call or get an existing call

  return (
    <StreamCall call={call}>
      <CallContent />
    </StreamCall>
  );
};
```

## Props

### `layout`

This switches the list between the grid and the spotlight mode.

| Type                  | Default Value |
| --------------------- | ------------- |
| `grid` \| `spotlight` | `grid`        |

:::note
When a screen is shared, the layout automatically changes to `spotlight` mode.
