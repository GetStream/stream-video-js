The React Native Video SDK ships with a default UI theme that is included in your application. In this chapter, we'll go through the details on how you can utilize and customize the default theme.

### Usage

To accurately create a theme we suggest utilizing our exported types to create your own theme. This will allow you to ensure the keys you are using in your theme object are correct.

When you provide a theme as a prop a deep merge of the theme and default theme is performed so only styles designated in the custom theme overwrite the defaults. We provide a helper type DeepPartial that makes all of the keys at every depth optional, this is to account for the deep merge that is performed.

You can find the default theme object in [theme.ts](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/blob/main/packages/react-native-sdk/src/theme/theme.ts).

```tsx
import type { DeepPartial, Theme } from '@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk';

const theme: DeepPartial<Theme> = {
  callControls: {
    container: {
      backgroundColor: 'red',
    },
  },
};
```

Now you can provide these theme to the `style` prop of [`StreamVideo`](../core/stream-video/#style) component.

```tsx
import {
  StreamVideo,
  StreamVideoClient,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk';

export const App = () => {
  const client = new StreamVideoClient(/* ... */);

  return (
    <StreamVideo client={client} style={theme}>
      <MyUI />
    </StreamVideo>
  );
};
```

You can change the default button, icon and avatar variants using the `buttonSizes`, `iconSizes` and the `avatarSizes` under the `variants` property.

The font style and the colors can be changed as well for different font and color usages within the SDK using the `typefaces` and the `colors` property.
