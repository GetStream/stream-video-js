LocalParticipantView displays the local video stream of the local participant if the video is unmuted. It can be used as both floating or full-screen view.

When the video is muted, the avatar of the local participant is shown, while when the view is floating, the video disabled icon is shown, both with a disabled background.

:::note
By default, the `LocalParticipantView` renders in a floating mode.
