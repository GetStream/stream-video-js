The `ReactionModal` is a [modal](https://reactnative.dev/docs/modal) designed to show all the available reactions in the application and allows sending the reaction when tapped.

The `ReactionModal` component internally lists all the reactions that are supported through the `StreamVideoRN` config. By default, we support '👍', '✋', and '🎉' reactions on our SDK. But this is fully customizable from the app. To do that, you can call the following from your application:

```tsx
StreamVideoRN.updateConfig({
  supportedReactions: [
    { type: 'reaction', emoji_code: ':smart:', custom: {}, icon: '😎' },
  ],
});
```

:::note
Make sure you follow the adhere to the types of the [`StreamReaction`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/blob/main/packages/react-native-sdk/src/utils/StreamVideoRN/types.ts#L4) type to create a new reaction.
