## Client & Auth

Before joining a call, it is necessary to set up the video client. Here's a basic example:

```ts
import { StreamVideoClient, User } from '@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk';

const user: User = {
  id: 'sara';
};

const user: User = {
  id: 'sara',
};
const apiKey = 'my-stream-api-key';
const token = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...';
const client = new StreamVideoClient({ apiKey, token, user });
```

- The API Key can be found in your dashboard.
- The user can be either authenticated, anonymous or guest.
- Note: You can store custom data on the user object, if required.

Typically, you'll want to initialize the client when your application loads and use a context provider to make it available to the rest of your application.

## Generating a token

Tokens need to be generated server side. You can use our [server side SDKs](https://getstream.io/video/docs/api/authentication/) to quickly add support for this.
Typically, you integrate this into the part of your codebase where you log in or register users.
The tokens provide a way to authenticate a user or give access to a specific set of calls.

For development purposes, you can use our [Token Generator](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/token_generator/).

## Different types of users

- Authenticated users are users that have an account on your app.
- Guest users are temporary user accounts. You can use it to temporarily give someone a name and image when joining a call.
- Anonymous users are users that are not authenticated. It's common to use this for watching a livestream or similar where you aren't authenticated.

This example shows the client setup for a guest user:

```ts
import { StreamVideoClient, User } from '@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk';

const user: User = {
  id: 'jack-guest',
  type: 'guest',
};

const apiKey = 'my-stream-api-key';
const client = new StreamVideoClient({ apiKey, user });
```

And here's an example for an anonymous user

```ts
import { StreamVideoClient, User } from '@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk';

const user: User = {
  type: 'anonymous',
};

const apiKey = 'my-stream-api-key';
const client = new StreamVideoClient({ apiKey, user });
```

## Client options

### `token` or `tokenProvider`

To authenticate users you can either provide a string `token` or a `tokenProvider` function that returns `Promise<string>`.
If you use the `tokenProvider` the SDK will automatically call the provider whenever the token is expired.

```typescript
import { StreamVideoClient, User } from '@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk';

const tokenProvider = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/token');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.token;
};

const user: User = {
  id: 'sara',
};
const apiKey = 'my-stream-api-key';
const client = new StreamVideoClient({ apiKey, tokenProvider, user });
```

### Logging

You can configure the log level and the logger method used by the SDK.

The default log level is `warn`, other options are: `debug`, `info`, and `error`.

The default logger method will log to the browser `console`.

```ts
import { StreamVideoClient, Logger } from '@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk';

const myLogger: Logger;

const client = new StreamVideoClient({
  apiKey,
  token,
  user,
  options: {
    logLevel: 'info',
    logger: myLogger,
  },
});
```

## StreamVideo context provider

You can use the `StreamVideo` context provider to make the SDK client available to the rest of the application. We also use the `tokenProvider` to show how to perform auth server-side.

```tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import {
  StreamVideo,
  StreamVideoClient,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk';
const apiKey = 'my-stream-api-key';
const user: User = {
  id: 'sara',
};

export const MyApp = () => {
  const [client, setClient] = useState<StreamVideoClient>();
  useEffect(() => {
    const tokenProvider = () => Promise.resolve('<token>');
    const myClient = new StreamVideoClient({ apiKey, user, tokenProvider });
    setClient(myClient);
    return () => {
      myClient.disconnectUser();
      setClient(undefined);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <StreamVideo client={client}>
      <MyVideoApp />
    </StreamVideo>
  );
};
```
