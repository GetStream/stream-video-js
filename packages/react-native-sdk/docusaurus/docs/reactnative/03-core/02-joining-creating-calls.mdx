description: An overview of how to create calls and join them
---

This guide shows how to create, join, leave, and end call rooms and ring calls.

## Call room

### Create and join a call

You create a call by specifying a call type and a call id.

```ts
const callType = 'default';
const callId = 'test-call';
await videoClient.call(callType, callId).join({ create: true });
```

The [call type](../../core/configuring-call-types) controls which features are enabled, and sets up permissions.

One of the flags you can provide there is `create`. Set this to `true` if you want to enable creating new calls. Set it to `false` if you only want to allow joining existing calls.

See all possible options at the [Call creation options section](#call-creation-options)

If you don't want to join a call, just create one, you can use the `getOrCreate` method:

```typescript
const callType = 'default';
const callId = 'test-call';
await videoClient.call(callType, callId).getOrCreate();
```

See all possible options at the [Call creation options section](#call-creation-options)

### Leave call

To leave a call, you can use the `leave` method:

```typescript
call.leave();
```

### End call

Ending a call requires a [special permission](../../core/permissions-and-moderation/). This action terminates the call for everyone.

```typescript
call.endCall();
```

Only users with special permission can join an ended call.

## Ring call

### Create call

To create a ring call, we need to set the `ring` flag to `true` and provide the list of members we want to call.
It is important to note that the caller should also be included in the list of members.

```typescript
client.call('default', 'test-outgoing-call').getOrCreate({
  // highlight-next-line
  ring: true,
  data: {
    members: [
      // highlight-next-line
      { user_id: 'myself' },
      { user_id: 'my friend' },
    ],
  },
});
```

See all possible options at the [Call creation options section](#call-creation-options)

This step will start the signaling flow.
The caller will automatically join the call once the first callee accepts the call.
The calling will automatically stop if all callee rejects the call.

:::note
When ring is true, a push notification will be sent to the members, provided their app have the required setup. For more details around push notifications, please check [this page](../../advanced/push-notifications/setup).

### Watch for incoming and outgoing calls

The easiest way to watch for incoming and outgoing calls is to use the `useCalls` hook.

```tsx
import { useCalls, CallingState } from '@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk';

export const MyCallUI = () => {
  const calls = useCalls();

  // handle incoming ring calls
  const incomingCalls = calls.filter(
    (call) =>
      call.isCreatedByMe === false &&
      call.state.callingState === CallingState.RINGING,
  );

  const [incomingCall] = incomingCalls;
  if (incomingCall) {
    // render the incoming call UI
    return <MyIncomingCallUI call={incomingCall} />;
  }

  // handle outgoing ring calls
  const outgoingCalls = calls.filter(
    (call) =>
      call.isCreatedByMe === true &&
      call.state.callingState === CallingState.RINGING,
  );

  const [outgoingCall] = outgoingCalls;
  if (outgoingCall) {
    // render the outgoing call UI
    return <MyOutgoingCallUI call={outgoingCall} />;
  }

  return null;
};
```

### Canceling a call

A caller can cancel an outgoing call until the first callee accepts the call. Canceling a call will stop the signaling flow.

```typescript
call.leave();
```

Please note that calling `call.leave()` after joining the call won't stop the signaling flow.

### Accepting a call

A callee can accept or reject an incoming call. To accept and join the call:

```typescript
call.join();
```

Please note that it's possible to join multiple calls. If you only want to allow one active call, you must leave joined calls before accepting an incoming call.

### Rejecting a call

A callee can accept or reject an incoming call. To reject the call:

```typescript
call.leave({ reject: true });
```

### Leave call

To leave a joined call, you can use the `leave` method:

```typescript
call.leave();
```

### End call

Ending a call requires a [special permission](../../core/permissions-and-moderation). This action terminates the call for everyone.

```typescript
call.endCall();
```

## Call creation options

The following options are supported when creating a call:

| Option     | Description                                                                                                     | Default |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `members`  | A list of members to add to this call. You can specify the role and custom data on these members                | -       |
| `custom`   | Any custom data you want to store                                                                               | -       |
| `settings` | You can overwrite certain call settings for this specific call. This overwrites the call type standard settings | -       |
| `startsAt` | When the call will start. Used for calls scheduled in the future, livestreams, audio rooms etc                  | -       |
| `team`     | Restrict the access to this call to a specific team                                                             | -       |
| `ring`     | If you want the call to ring for each member                                                                    | false   |
| `notify`   | If you want the call to notify each member by sending push notification                                         | false   |
