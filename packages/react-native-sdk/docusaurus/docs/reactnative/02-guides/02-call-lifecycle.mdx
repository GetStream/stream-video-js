title: Call Lifecycle

When building your app with **Stream Video**, it's important to understand how the **lifecycle** of your app connects to our client and the Calls you join.

There are two main components that you need to initialize at various points in your app lifecycle:

* **StreamVideo** - The main client which lets you perform CRUD operations with calls.
* **VideoClient** - The client which handles just one specific call when the user joins as a participant.

Based on your app, you should initialize these at the latest possible time, when the users really need them, since they might not have to use any of the clients unless they want to engage in video calls.

As a high-level overview, you can see the timeline of these three lifecycle scopes in the following diagram.

> **Note**: While the diagram shows the lifecycle of only one StreamVideo client and VideoClient, you can create many instances during a user session, if the user logs in and out multiple times, and joins and leaves multiple calls.

Let's see when it's best to initialize and dispose of these clients.

### StreamVideo

The `StreamVideo` client **requires an authenticated user** to be created and worked with.

If your application has steps where the user doesn't have to be authenticated, like anonymous browsing, exploring the app after installing, but before creating an account, or similar, then we **don't recommend** initializing the `StreamVideo` client right away.

But as soon as your user is authenticated, you can look into creating the client.

Since the instance contains all the operations to access existing calls, as well as create new ones, it's useful to keep it around when your users have access to different call features of your app.

**Some of these include**:

* Browsing a list of calls
* Creating new calls or inviting people to existing
* Ringing a group in chat-based applications or features
* Generating call URLs for invites

Additionally, the instance creates a Web Socket connection that listens to events like `CallCreated`, which you can use to show incoming call UI to your users or trigger custom business logic.

If your app relies on such events at its core, we recommend to initialize it **as soon as your user is authenticated**. Once you do that, make sure to **keep it in a high level component**, like the an application context, or any other state management lib. of your choice.
