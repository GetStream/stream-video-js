Welcome to the Stream Video React Native SDK - a comprehensive toolkit designed to help you swiftly implement features such as video calling, audio calling, audio rooms, and livestreaming within your app. Our goal is to ensure an optimal developer experience that enables your application to go live within days.

Our React Native SDK comes with user-friendly UI components, easy-to-use React hooks, and context providers/wrappers, making your development process seamless. Moreover, all calls are routed through Stream's global edge network, ensuring lower latency and higher reliability due to proximity to end users.

If you're new to Stream React Native Video SDK, we recommend starting with the following three tutorials, depending upon your requirements:

- [Video & Audio Calling Tutorial](./tutorials/video-calling)

- Core concepts such as [initiating a call](./core/joining-and-creating-calls/), switching the [camera](./core/camera-and-microphone/) view, and more
- Effective utilization of our UI components
- Insights on building your own UI with our [UI Cookbook](./ui-cookbook/overview/)

It also explains advanced features such as:

- [Ringing/Calls](./core/joining-and-creating-calls/)
