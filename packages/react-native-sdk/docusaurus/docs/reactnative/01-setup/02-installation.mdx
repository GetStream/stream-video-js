description: Install the SDK for video calling

### Prerequisites

First things first, make sure you have set up the development environment for React Native.
You can find the official guide [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

### Add Stream's Video SDK and its peer dependencies

In order to install the Stream Video SDK and all its peer dependencies run the following command in your terminal of choice:

```bash
yarn add @stream-io/video-react-native-sdk react-native-webrtc react-native-callkeep react-native-device-info react-native-incall-manager react-native-svg text-encoding-polyfill react-native-url-polyfill intl-pluralrules @react-native-community/netinfo @notifee/react-native
```

The following dependencies require additional configuration steps for the installation to be successful and all their functionalities to be available.
Please follow the links below to complete the installation process:

- `react-native-webrtc` installation on [Android](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-webrtc/blob/master/Documentation/AndroidInstallation.md) and [iOS](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-webrtc/blob/master/Documentation/iOSInstallation.md).
- `react-native-svg` be aware of [compatibility](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg#supported-react-native-versions) with RN versions and [troubleshooting](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg#troubleshooting) steps.
- `react-native-incall-manager` installation on [Android](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-incall-manager#android) and [iOS](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-incall-manager#ios).

So what did we install precisely?

- `@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk` (SVRN) is Stream's Video SDK which contains UI components, hooks and util functions that will enable audio/video calls.
- `react-native-webrtc` is a WebRTC module for React Native, SVRN depends on this dependency, it's components and utilities to render audio/video tracks and interact with the phone's media devices.
- `react-native-device-info` is responsible for retrieving device info and sending it to the Stream Video servers.
- `react-native-incall-manager` handles media-routes/sensors/events during an audio/video call.
- `react-native-svg` provides SVG support to React Native, SVRN's components and it's icons are reliant on this dependency.
- `text-encoding-polyfill` a polyfill for the `Encoding Living Standard` API, allowing encoding and decoding of textual data to and from Typed Array buffers for binary data in React Native.
- `react-native-url-polyfill` is an implementation of the `WHATWG URL` Standard optimized for React Native.
- `intl-pluralrules` - allows i18n with support for pluralization based on [`Intl.Plurales`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/PluralRules).
- `@react-native-community/netinfo` - is used to detect the device's connectivity state, type and quality.
- `@notifee/react-native` - is used to keep calls alive in the background on Android.

### Optional peer dependencies

Some of the optional features we provide require additional dependencies to be installed in order to work properly.

#### Ringing flow

The ringing flow is a feature that allows you to render a native ringer when the app is in background/dead mode.
To enable this feature you need to install the following dependencies:

- `react-native-callkeep` utilises CallKit (iOS) and ConnectionService (Android). SVRN's uses this dependency to render native ringers and handle accepting/declining a call when the app is in background/dead mode.
- `@react-native-firebase/app` and `@react-native-firebase/messaging` to receive notifications on Android.
- `@react-native-voip-push-notification` to receive notifications on iOS.

More about how to enable this feature can be found [in our push notification guide](../../advanced/push-notifications/).

### Initial app setup: encoding and polyfills

Add the following imports and statements to your `index.js` file in the project's root.

```tsx
/** Initialize text encoder/decoder polyfill */
import 'text-encoding-polyfill';
/** Initialize URL polyfill */
import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto';
/** i18next polyfill to handle intl format for pluralization. For more info see https://www.i18next.com/misc/json-format#i-18-next-json-v4 */
import 'intl-pluralrules';
import {registerGlobals} from 'react-native-webrtc';
...

// We're registering globals, because our video JS client is serving SDKs that use browser based webRTC functions.
// This will result in creation of 2 global objects: `window` and `navigator`
// Further [reading](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-webrtc/blob/16cff1523da457dbcc27bb0744ee2bad3a987c41/Documentation/BasicUsage.md#registering-globals) about this process
if (Platform.OS !== 'web') {
  registerGlobals();
}
```
