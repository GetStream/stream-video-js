description: Install the SDK for video calling
---

Installation and usage of our React Native SDK is simple and involves the following steps:

### Prerequisites

First things first, make sure you have set up the development environment for React Native.
You can find the official guide [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

### Add Stream's Video SDK and its peer dependencies

In order to install the Stream Video React Native SDK, run the following command in your terminal of choice:

```bash title=Terminal
yarn add @stream-io/video-react-native-sdk
```

Stream Video React Native SDK requires installing some peer dependencies to provide you with a great calling experience. You can run the following command to install them:

```bash title=Terminal
yarn add react-native-webrtc react-native-device-info \
   react-native-incall-manager react-native-svg \
   @react-native-community/netinfo @notifee/react-native
npx pod-install
```

So what did we install precisely?

- `@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk` (SVRN) is Stream's Video SDK which contains UI components, hooks and util functions that will enable audio/video calls.
- `react-native-webrtc` is a WebRTC module for React Native, SVRN depends on this dependency, it's components and utilities to render audio/video tracks and interact with the phone's media devices.
- `react-native-device-info` is responsible for retrieving device info and sending it to the Stream Video servers.
- `react-native-incall-manager` handles media-routes/sensors/events during an audio/video call.
- `react-native-svg` provides SVG support to React Native, SVRN's components and it's icons are reliant on this dependency.
- `@react-native-community/netinfo` - is used to detect the device's connectivity state, type and quality.
- `@notifee/react-native` - is used to keep calls alive in the background on Android.

### Android Specific installation

#### Enable Java 8 Support

In `android/app/build.gradle` add the following inside the `android` section:

```
compileOptions {
	sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
	targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
}
```

#### Disable desugaring

In `android/gradle.properties` add the following:

```
# This one fixes a weird WebRTC runtime problem on some devices.
# https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/7911#issuecomment-714323255

android.enableDexingArtifactTransform.desugaring=false
```

#### Optional: R8/ProGuard Support

If you require R8/ProGuard support then in `android/app/proguard-rules.pro` add the following on a new line:

```
-keep class org.webrtc.** { *; }
```

### Declaring Permissions

Making video or audio calls requires the usage of the device's camera and microphone accordingly. Therefore, before you can make and answer calls, you need to request permission to use them within your application. First, in both platforms we must declare the permissions.

#### iOS

Add the following keys and values to `Info.plist` file at a minimum:

- `Privacy - Camera Usage Description` - "`<Your_app_name>` requires camera access to capture and transmit video"
- `Privacy - Microphone Usage Description` - "`<Your_app_name>` requires microphone access to capture and transmit audio"

:::note
You should replace `<Your_app_name>` (or also use your custom strings instead).
:::

#### Android

In `AndroidManifest.xml` add the following permissions before the `<application>` section.

```xml
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.audio.output" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.microphone" />

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

If you plan to also support Bluetooth devices then also add the following.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
```


:::note
The SDK needs to know to the state of camera and microphone permissions to get video and audio streams. We can inform the states to the SDK through the following:
```ts
import { StreamVideoRN } from '@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk';

StreamVideoRN.setPermissions({
  isCameraPermissionGranted: true,
  isMicPermissionGranted: true,
});
```
 We have discussed a detailed solution to manage native runtime permissions in the [Manage Native Permissions](../../core/native-permissions) guide.

### Optional peer dependencies

Some of the optional features we provide require additional dependencies to be installed in order to work properly.

#### Ringing flow

The ringing flow is a feature that allows you to render a native ringer when the app is in background/dead mode.
To enable this feature you need to install the following dependencies:

- `react-native-callkeep` utilises CallKit (iOS) and ConnectionService (Android). SVRN's uses this dependency to render native ringers and handle accepting/declining a call when the app is in background/dead mode.
- `@react-native-firebase/app` and `@react-native-firebase/messaging` to receive notifications on Android.
- `@react-native-voip-push-notification` to receive notifications on iOS.

More about how to enable this feature can be found [in our push notification guide](../../advanced/push-notifications/setup).
