description: Install the SDK in Expo Development Builds
---

Our SDK is not available on Expo Go due to native code being required, but you can use the [expo-dev-client](https://docs.expo.dev/development/create-development-builds/) library to run your Expo app with a development build.

## Development Build

If you haven't already, prepare your project for [expo development builds](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/installation/).

## SDK Installation

Add the SDK and its required dependencies to your project:

```bash title=Terminal
npx expo install @stream-io/video-react-native-sdk @stream-io/react-native-webrtc \
   @config-plugins/react-native-webrtc react-native-device-info \
   react-native-incall-manager react-native-svg \
   @react-native-community/netinfo @notifee/react-native
```

So what did we install precisely?

- `@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk` (SVRN) is Stream's Video SDK which contains UI components, hooks and util functions that will enable audio/video calls.
- `@stream-io/react-native-webrtc` is a WebRTC module for React Native, SVRN depends on this dependency, it's components and utilities to render audio/video tracks and interact with the phone's media devices.
- `react-native-device-info` is responsible for retrieving device info and sending it to the Stream Video servers.
- `react-native-incall-manager` handles media-routes/sensors/events during an audio/video call.
- `react-native-svg` provides SVG support to React Native, SVRN's components and it's icons are reliant on this dependency.
- `@react-native-community/netinfo` - is used to detect the device's connectivity state, type and quality.
- `@notifee/react-native` - is used to keep calls alive in the background on Android.

### Add Stream Video SDK's setup method

Once the peer dependencies are installed, a native setup method needs to be added:

#### Android

Add the following in your `MainApplication.java` file:

<!-- vale off -->
```java
// highlight-next-line
import com.streamvideo.reactnative.StreamVideoReactNative;

public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {

  @Override
  public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    // highlight-next-line
    StreamVideoReactNative.setup();
    // the rest..
  }
}
```
<!-- vale on -->

#### iOS

Add the following in your `AppDelegate.m` or `AppDelegate.mm` file:

```c
// highlight-next-line
#import "StreamVideoReactNative.h"

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
  // highlight-next-line
  [StreamVideoReactNative setup];

  // the rest..
}
```

## Add config plugin

Add the config plugin for `react-native-webrtc` to your `app.json` file:

```js
{
  "expo": {
    ...
    "plugins": [
      [
        "@config-plugins/react-native-webrtc",
        {
          "cameraPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your camera",
          "microphonePermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

You can now create development builds with `eas build --profile development --local`.
