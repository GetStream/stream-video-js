description: Install the SDK in Expo Development Builds
---

Our SDK is not available on Expo Go due to native code being required, but you can use the [expo-dev-client](https://docs.expo.dev/development/create-development-builds/) library to run your Expo app with a development build.

## Development Build

If you haven't already, prepare your project for [expo development builds](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/installation/).

## SDK Installation

Add the SDK and its required dependencies to your project:

```bash title=Terminal
npx expo install @stream-io/video-react-native-sdk
npx expo install @stream-io/react-native-webrtc
npx expo install @config-plugins/react-native-webrtc
npx expo install react-native-incall-manager
npx expo install react-native-svg
npx expo install @react-native-community/netinfo
npx expo install @notifee/react-native
```

So what did we install precisely?

- `@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk` (SVRN) is Stream's Video SDK which contains UI components, hooks and util functions that will enable audio/video calls.
- `@stream-io/react-native-webrtc` is a WebRTC module for React Native, SVRN depends on this dependency, it's components and utilities to render audio/video tracks and interact with the phone's media devices.
- `react-native-incall-manager` handles media-routes/sensors/events during an audio/video call.
- `react-native-svg` provides SVG support to React Native, SVRN's components and it's icons are reliant on this dependency.
- `@react-native-community/netinfo` - is used to detect the device's connectivity state, type and quality.
- `@notifee/react-native` - is used to keep calls alive in the background on Android.

## Add config plugin

Add the config plugin for [`@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/tree/main/packages/react-native-sdk/expo-config-plugin/README.md) and [`react-native-webrtc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@config-plugins/react-native-webrtc) to your `app.json` file:

```js title=app.json
{
  "expo": {
    ...
    "plugins": [
      // highlight-start
      "@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk",
      [
        "@config-plugins/react-native-webrtc",
        {
          // optionally you can add your own explanations for permissions on iOS
          "cameraPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your camera",
          "microphonePermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone"
        }
      ]
      // highlight-end
    ]
  }
}
```

:::note
The `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` and `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` permissions need to be requested and granted by the user as well. [PermissionsAndroid](https://reactnative.dev/docs/permissionsandroid) module can be used to request permissions in Android. For example, below is a way to request permissions in Android:

```js
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { PermissionsAndroid, Platform } from 'react-native';

useEffect(() => {
  const run = async () => {
    if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
      // highlight-start
      await PermissionsAndroid.requestMultiple([
        'android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS',
        'android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT',
      ]);
      // highlight-end
    }
  };
  run();
}, []);
```
