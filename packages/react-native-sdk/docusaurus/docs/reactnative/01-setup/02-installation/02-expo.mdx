description: Install the SDK in Expo Development Builds

Our SDK is not available on Expo Go due to native code being required, but you can use the [expo-dev-client](https://docs.expo.dev/development/create-development-builds/) library to run your Expo app with a development build.

### Development Build

If you haven't already, prepare your project for [expo development builds](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/installation/).

## SDK Installation

Add the Stream Video React Native SDK and its required dependencies to your project:

```bash title=Terminal
npx expo install @stream-io/video-react-native-sdk
npx expo install @stream-io/react-native-webrtc
npx expo install @config-plugins/react-native-webrtc
npx expo install react-native-incall-manager
npx expo install react-native-svg
npx expo install @react-native-community/netinfo
```

So what did we install precisely?

- `@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk` (SVRN) is Stream's Video SDK which contains UI components, hooks and util functions that will enable audio/video calls.
- `@stream-io/react-native-webrtc` is a WebRTC module for React Native, SVRN depends on this dependency, it's components and utilities to render audio/video tracks and interact with the phone's media devices.
- `@config-plugins/react-native-webrtc` is the expo config plugin for the WebRTC module for React Native.
- `react-native-incall-manager` handles media-routes/sensors/events during an audio/video call.
- `react-native-svg` provides SVG support to React Native, SVRN's components and it's icons are reliant on this dependency.
- `@react-native-community/netinfo` - is used to detect the device's connectivity state, type and quality.

### Android Specific installation

<!-- vale off -->
#### Update the minSdk version

In your `app.json` file add the following to the `expo-build-properties` plugin:

```js title=app.json
{
  "expo": {
    ...
    "plugins": [
      // highlight-start
      "expo-build-properties",
      {
        "android": {
          "minSdkVersion": 24
        }
      }
      // highlight-end
    ]
  }
}
```
<!-- vale on -->

### Add config plugin

Add the config plugin for [`@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/tree/main/packages/react-native-sdk/expo-config-plugin/README.md) and [`react-native-webrtc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@config-plugins/react-native-webrtc) to your `app.json` file:

```js title=app.json
{
  "expo": {
    ...
    "plugins": [
      // highlight-start
      "@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk",
      [
        "@config-plugins/react-native-webrtc",
        {
          // optionally you can add your own explanations for permissions on iOS
          "cameraPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your camera",
          "microphonePermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone"
        }
      ]
      // highlight-end
    ]
  }
}
```

:::infoINFO
Permissions need to be granted by the user as well. Requests for Camera and Microphone usage are automatically asked when the stream is first requested by the app. But other permissions like `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` in Android need to be requested manually. However, we recommend that all necessary permissions be manually asked at an appropriate place in your app for the best user experience.

We recommend the usage of [`react-native-permissions`](https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-permissions) library to request permissions in the app.

### Run on device

#### iOS 

In iOS simulators, recording audio or video is not supported. So always test your app on an actual device for the best experience.

#### Android

In Android emulators, a static video stream can be sent and so it can be used for testing. However, we recommend that you always test your app on an actual device for the best experience.
