Installation and usage of our React Native SDK is simple and involves the following steps:

### Prerequisites

First things first, make sure you have set up the development environment for React Native.
You can find the official guide [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

## SDK Installation

In order to install the Stream Video React Native SDK, run the following command in your terminal of choice:

```bash title=Terminal
yarn add @stream-io/video-react-native-sdk
```

Stream Video React Native SDK requires installing some peer dependencies to provide you with a great calling experience. You can run the following command to install them:

```bash title=Terminal
yarn add @stream-io/react-native-webrtc \
   react-native-incall-manager react-native-svg \
   @react-native-community/netinfo
npx pod-install
```

So what did we install precisely?

- `@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk` (SVRN) is Stream's Video SDK which contains UI components, hooks and util functions that will enable audio/video calls.
- `@stream-io/react-native-webrtc` is a WebRTC module for React Native, SVRN depends on this dependency, it's components and utilities to render audio/video tracks and interact with the phone's media devices.
- `react-native-incall-manager` handles media-routes/sensors/events during an audio/video call.
- `react-native-svg` provides SVG support to React Native, SVRN's components and it's icons are reliant on this dependency.
- `@react-native-community/netinfo` - is used to detect the device's connectivity state, type and quality.

### Android Specific installation

<!-- vale off -->
#### Update the minSdk version

In `android/build.gradle` add the following inside the `buildscript` section:

```java
buildscript {
    ext {
        ...
        minSdkVersion = 24
    }
    ...
}
```
<!-- vale on -->

#### Enable Java 8 Support

In `android/app/build.gradle` add the following inside the `android` section:

```java
compileOptions {
	sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
	targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_11
}
```

#### Optional: R8/ProGuard Support

If you require R8/ProGuard support then in `android/app/proguard-rules.pro` add the following on a new line:

```groovy
-keep class org.webrtc.** { *; }
```

### Declaring Permissions

Making video or audio calls requires the usage of the device's camera and microphone accordingly. In both platforms, we must declare the permissions.

#### iOS

Add the following keys and values to `Info.plist` file at a minimum:

- `Privacy - Camera Usage Description` - "`<Your_app_name>` requires camera access to capture and transmit video"
- `Privacy - Microphone Usage Description` - "`<Your_app_name>` requires microphone access to capture and transmit audio"

:::note
You should replace `<Your_app_name>` (or also use your custom strings instead).
:::

#### Android

In `AndroidManifest.xml` add the following permissions before the `<application>` section.

```xml
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.audio.output" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.microphone" />

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

If you plan to also support Bluetooth devices then also add the following.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
```

:::infoINFO
Permissions need to be granted by the user as well. Requests for Camera and Microphone usage are automatically asked when the stream is first requested by the app. But other permissions like `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` in Android need to be requested manually. However, we recommend that all necessary permissions be manually asked at an appropriate place in your app for the best user experience.

We recommend the usage of [`react-native-permissions`](https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-permissions) library to request permissions in the app.

:::

### Run on device

#### iOS 

In iOS simulators, recording audio or video is not supported. So always test your app on an actual device for the best experience.

#### Android

In Android emulators, a static video stream can be sent and so it can be used for testing. However, we recommend that you always test your app on an actual device for the best experience.
