Installation and usage of our React Native SDK is simple and involves the following steps:

### Prerequisites

First things first, make sure you have set up the development environment for React Native.
You can find the official guide [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

### Add Stream's Video SDK and its peer dependencies

In order to install the Stream Video React Native SDK, run the following command in your terminal of choice:

```bash title=Terminal
yarn add @stream-io/video-react-native-sdk
```

Stream Video React Native SDK requires installing some peer dependencies to provide you with a great calling experience. You can run the following command to install them:

```bash title=Terminal
yarn add @stream-io/react-native-webrtc \
   react-native-incall-manager react-native-svg \
   @react-native-community/netinfo @notifee/react-native
npx pod-install
```

So what did we install precisely?

- `@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk` (SVRN) is Stream's Video SDK which contains UI components, hooks and util functions that will enable audio/video calls.
- `@stream-io/react-native-webrtc` is a WebRTC module for React Native, SVRN depends on this dependency, it's components and utilities to render audio/video tracks and interact with the phone's media devices.
- `react-native-incall-manager` handles media-routes/sensors/events during an audio/video call.
- `react-native-svg` provides SVG support to React Native, SVRN's components and it's icons are reliant on this dependency.
- `@react-native-community/netinfo` - is used to detect the device's connectivity state, type and quality.
- `@notifee/react-native` - is used to keep calls alive in the background on Android.

### Android Specific installation

<!-- vale off -->
#### Update the compileSdk, targetSdk and minSdk versions

In `android/build.gradle` add the following inside the `buildscript` section:

```java
buildscript {
    ext {
        ...
        minSdkVersion = 24
        compileSdkVersion = 34
        targetSdkVersion = 33
    }
    ...
}
```

:::infoINFO
We have to temporarily use targetSdkVersion 33 due to a lack of support for [dynamically setting foreground service types](https://github.com/invertase/notifee/issues/997#issuecomment-2036781216) in the notifee library. We are aware of the [August 31, 2024 deadline](https://apilevels.com/) for updating to targetSdkVersion 34 and we are actively working on adding support in the notifee library.

<!-- vale on -->

#### Enable Java 8 Support

In `android/app/build.gradle` add the following inside the `android` section:

```java
compileOptions {
	sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
	targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_11
}
```

#### Disable desugaring

In `android/gradle.properties` add the following:

```groovy
# This one fixes a weird WebRTC runtime problem on some devices.

android.enableDexingArtifactTransform.desugaring=false
```

#### Optional: R8/ProGuard Support

If you require R8/ProGuard support then in `android/app/proguard-rules.pro` add the following on a new line:

```groovy
-keep class org.webrtc.** { *; }
```

### Declaring Permissions

Making video or audio calls requires the usage of the device's camera and microphone accordingly. In both platforms, we must declare the permissions.

#### iOS

Add the following keys and values to `Info.plist` file at a minimum:

- `Privacy - Camera Usage Description` - "`<Your_app_name>` requires camera access to capture and transmit video"
- `Privacy - Microphone Usage Description` - "`<Your_app_name>` requires microphone access to capture and transmit audio"

:::note
You should replace `<Your_app_name>` (or also use your custom strings instead).
:::

#### Android

In `AndroidManifest.xml` add the following permissions before the `<application>` section.

```xml
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.audio.output" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.microphone" />

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

If you plan to also support Bluetooth devices then also add the following.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
```

### Optional peer dependencies

Some of the optional features we provide require additional dependencies to be installed in order to work properly.

#### Ringing flow

The ringing flow is a feature that allows you to render a native ringer when the app is in background/dead mode.
To enable this feature you need to install the following dependencies:

- `react-native-callkeep` utilises CallKit (iOS) and ConnectionService (Android). SVRN's uses this dependency to render native ringers and handle accepting/declining a call when the app is in background/dead mode.
- `@react-native-firebase/app` and `@react-native-firebase/messaging` to receive notifications on Android.
- `@react-native-voip-push-notification` to receive notifications on iOS.

More about how to enable this feature can be found [in our push notification guide](../../../advanced/push-notifications/overview).
