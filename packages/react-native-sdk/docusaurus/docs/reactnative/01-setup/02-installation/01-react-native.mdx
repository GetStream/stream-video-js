title: React Native
---

Installation and usage of our React Native SDK is simple and involves the following steps:

### Prerequisites

First things first, make sure you have set up the development environment for React Native.
You can find the official guide [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

### Add Stream's Video SDK and its peer dependencies

In order to install the Stream Video React Native SDK, run the following command in your terminal of choice:

```bash title=Terminal
yarn add @stream-io/video-react-native-sdk
```

Stream Video React Native SDK requires installing some peer dependencies to provide you with a great calling experience. You can run the following command to install them:

```bash title=Terminal
yarn add @stream-io/react-native-webrtc \
   react-native-incall-manager react-native-svg \
   @react-native-community/netinfo @notifee/react-native
npx pod-install
```

So what did we install precisely?

- `@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk` (SVRN) is Stream's Video SDK which contains UI components, hooks and util functions that will enable audio/video calls.
- `@stream-io/react-native-webrtc` is a WebRTC module for React Native, SVRN depends on this dependency, it's components and utilities to render audio/video tracks and interact with the phone's media devices.
- `react-native-incall-manager` handles media-routes/sensors/events during an audio/video call.
- `react-native-svg` provides SVG support to React Native, SVRN's components and it's icons are reliant on this dependency.
- `@react-native-community/netinfo` - is used to detect the device's connectivity state, type and quality.
- `@notifee/react-native` - is used to keep calls alive in the background on Android.

### Add Stream Video SDK's setup method

Once the peer dependencies are installed, a native setup method needs to be added:

#### Android

Add the following in your `MainApplication.java` file:

<!-- vale off -->

```java
// highlight-next-line
import com.streamvideo.reactnative.StreamVideoReactNative;

public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {

  @Override
  public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    // highlight-next-line
    StreamVideoReactNative.setup();
    // the rest..
  }
}
```

<!-- vale on -->

#### iOS

Add the following in your `AppDelegate.m` or `AppDelegate.mm` file:

```c
// highlight-next-line
#import "StreamVideoReactNative.h"

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
  // highlight-next-line
  [StreamVideoReactNative setup];

  // the rest..
}
```

### Android Specific installation

#### Enable Java 8 Support

In `android/app/build.gradle` add the following inside the `android` section:

```java
compileOptions {
	sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
	targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_11
}
```

#### Disable desugaring

In `android/gradle.properties` add the following:

```groovy
# This one fixes a weird WebRTC runtime problem on some devices.

android.enableDexingArtifactTransform.desugaring=false
```

#### Optional: R8/ProGuard Support

If you require R8/ProGuard support then in `android/app/proguard-rules.pro` add the following on a new line:

```groovy
-keep class org.webrtc.** { *; }
```

### Declaring Permissions

Making video or audio calls requires the usage of the device's camera and microphone accordingly. In both platforms, we must declare the permissions.

#### iOS

Add the following keys and values to `Info.plist` file at a minimum:

- `Privacy - Camera Usage Description` - "`<Your_app_name>` requires camera access to capture and transmit video"
- `Privacy - Microphone Usage Description` - "`<Your_app_name>` requires microphone access to capture and transmit audio"

:::note
You should replace `<Your_app_name>` (or also use your custom strings instead).
:::

#### Android

In `AndroidManifest.xml` add the following permissions before the `<application>` section.

```xml
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.audio.output" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.microphone" />

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

If you plan to also support Bluetooth devices then also add the following.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
```

### Optional peer dependencies

Some of the optional features we provide require additional dependencies to be installed in order to work properly.

#### Ringing flow

The ringing flow is a feature that allows you to render a native ringer when the app is in background/dead mode.
To enable this feature you need to install the following dependencies:

- `react-native-callkeep` utilises CallKit (iOS) and ConnectionService (Android). SVRN's uses this dependency to render native ringers and handle accepting/declining a call when the app is in background/dead mode.
- `@react-native-firebase/app` and `@react-native-firebase/messaging` to receive notifications on Android.
- `@react-native-voip-push-notification` to receive notifications on iOS.

More about how to enable this feature can be found [in our push notification guide](../../advanced/push-notifications/setup).
