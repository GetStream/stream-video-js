In this guide, we will cover the basics of making your first call using Stream Video.
If you haven't already, we recommend starting with the **[introduction](../../)** and **[installation](../installation)** steps first, as this guide will build on the material covered in those sections.

## Client setup & Calls

Create an instance of `StreamVideoClient` that will establish a WebSocket connection by connecting a user. Next, you create a call object and join the call. We'll specify `create: true` to create the call if it doesn't exist.

```tsx
import {
  StreamCall,
  StreamVideo,
  StreamVideoClient,
  User,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const apiKey = 'your-api-key';
const userId = 'user-id';
const token = 'authentication-token';
const callId = 'my-call-id';
const user: User = { id: userId };

export default function App() {
  const [client] = useState(
    () => new StreamVideoClient({ apiKey, user, token }),
  );
  const [call] = useState(() => client.call('default', callId));

  useEffect(() => {
    call.join({ create: true });
  }, [call]);

  return (
    <StreamVideo client={client}>
      <StreamCall call={call}>
        {/* We will add the video UI in the next step */}
      </StreamCall>
    </StreamVideo>
  );
}
```

When creating a call on the client, the string `default` is a call type. There are 4 built-in [call types](../../core/configuring-call-types/). and you can also create your own.
The call type controls the permissions and which features are enabled.

The second argument is the call id. Call ids can be reused, meaning it's possible to join a call with the same id multiple times (for example, for recurring meetings).

## Rendering video

The call participant's state can be accessed using hooks like `useParticipants`. Have a look below for a basic example of how to render the videos of all participants:

```tsx
import {
  CallParticipantsListView,
  useParticipants,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk';

function VideoUI() {
  const participants = useParticipants();

  return <CallParticipantsListView participants={participants} />;
}
```

The participant object contains all essential information to render videos, such as audio/video tracks, user information, audio/video enabled status, etc.

More information about state management can be found in the [Call & Participant State guide](../../core/call-and-participant-state).

## Camera & Microphone

Most video apps will show buttons to mute/unmute the audio or video. The example below shows how to use the camera and microphone:

```tsx
import { useMediaStreamManagement } from '@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk';

// You can use this hook inside your component
const {
  publishAudioStream,
  publishVideoStream,
  stopPublishingAudio,
  stopPublishingVideo,
  isCameraOnFrontFacingMode,
  toggleCameraFacingMode,
} = useMediaStreamManagement();
```

With the help of the `useMediaStreamManagement` hook, you can manage the camera and audio of the device.

- `publishAudioStream`/` stopPublishingAudio` can be used to publish/un-publish the audio stream.
- `publishVideoStream`/` stopPublishingVideo` can be used to publish/un-publish the video stream.
- `isCameraOnFrontFacingMode`/`toggleCameraFacingMode` is a function that flips the camera and gives the status of the current face of the camera.

More information about this topic can be found in the [Camera & Microphone guide](../../guides/camera-and-microphone).

## UI Components

The goal of this library is to make it easy to build any type of video/calling experience. You have a few options for the UI:

- Build your own UI components using the state as shown above.
- Use our library of built-in components.
- Mix & Match between your own and built-in components.

You can use and customize the [built-in components](../../ui-components/overview).
If you decide to build your own components we have a dedicated [UI Cookbook section](../../ui-cookbook/overview) to help you get started.
