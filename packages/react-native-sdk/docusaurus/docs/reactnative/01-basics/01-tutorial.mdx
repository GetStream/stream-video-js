## Introduction

Hi there and welcome to our Stream Video React Native tutorial.

`StreamVideo` is an SDK that facilitates adding calling (audio and video) support to your apps. It's a performant and highly customizable, allowing you to build various types of calling applications and streaming use cases, such as:

* **Messenger-style applications**: These applications implement Chat as a primary source of communication, with Video secondary.
* **Zoom-style applications**: Such apps focus primarily on Video, with Chat as a way to communicate while in a call.
* **Audio Rooms**: Our SDK allows you to build audio-only rooms that allow live communication, such as Twitter Spaces.
* **Livestreaming**: We support one of the most popular modern use cases - streaming audio and video to audiences. You can replicate apps like Twitch or YouTube Live.

This makes the Stream Video SDK the best-in-class choice when integrating Audio and Video communication in your apps. With all that in mind, let's dive into the tutorial.

## Tutorial Content

In this tutorial we'll cover the main steps required to produce a fully capable video chat app, using **Stream Video**. The application you're building is called `VideoTutorial` (fitting, I know), and its features will be the following:

- Creating a project & setting up Stream dependencies
- Authenticating the user
- Handling Stream Video lifecycle
- Creating & joining a Call
- Rendering Call UI and controls

By the end of the tutorial, you'll be more than capable of building an app that powers video calls, with deep knowledge of how our internal state management works. The app has only a few screens:

* **Login screen**: Used to select a user for the Calls.
* **Home screen**: Used to choose a Call ID, its participate and if you want to start a ringing or meeting call.
* **Call screen**: Central place for all the communication after joining a call.

If you're interested in what the application looks like and a small demo of how it works, make sure to check out the full [sample app](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/tree/main/) in our repository.

Once you're ready, we can start with the project.

## Starting the Project

> **Note**: In this tutorial, we'll be using Compose for the UI, but you can very much build this in XML too. Our state is pragmatic and can be integrated with the UI toolkit you prefer.

To get started with [Stream Video](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js), we have a great //todo: insert starter kit link that pre-bakes all the boilerplate UI and dependency code for you. The best way to work through the tutorial is using this project. To use the project, do the following:

1. Clone our [Stream Video](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js) repository to your local machine. If you're not sure how to clone the project, follow [GitHub's guide](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop#cloning-a-repository).

4. You should be good to go!

Once you clone and load the project, let it sync and download all the dependencies. Our SDKs are available from the NPM registery.

Now that you have the project ready, check out the Stream dependencies. Open your `tutorial-stater` module's `build.gradle` file and look for the following:

[//]: # (write the rest of teh guide)

You can see how you've simplified the UI, removed the unnecessary header information, call actions and similar. This is just a small piece of how powerful our SDK and its UI Components are. You can replace almost everything you can think of, while still keeping the internal state and business logic behavior the same.

This allows you to build rich and custom apps in less time than you would building everything yourself, or by using other third party providers.

## Further Integration

Congratulations on completing the Stream Video React Native SDK tutorial. You've learned how to build two very popular use cases - Meeting and Ringing Calls. However, our SDK supports multiple other use cases and more advanced features. If you're looking to integrate more of our supported functionality, we recommend checking out the following guides:

[//]: # (* [guide]&#40;05-advanced/02-push-notification/01-overview.mdx&#41;)
(../02-guides/04-socket-events.mdx)
* [Call Lifecycle](../02-guides/02-call-lifecycle.mdx): It's important to understand the lifecycle of our SDK and Calls to properly build complex use cases for your users.
* [Call Engine](../02-guides/03-call-engine.mdx): If you're looking to utilize our state machine to the fullest, explore what our internal CallEngine does and how to listen to state.
* [Deep linking](../05-advanced/01-deeplinking.mdx): Deep linking is very useful for Meeting apps where you can simply send a link for the Call that lets people join.
* [Push Notifications](../05-advanced/02-push-notifications.mdx): Apps where Ring people and invite them to Calls heavily rely on push notifications. Learn how to integrate them with our SDK.

Alternatively, if you're modeling your app based on popular apps, like Messenger, Telegram, Zoom, Google Meet, Twitter Spaces or Twitch, we have several guides and template projects prepared for you:

* [Chat + Video](../02-guides/06-chat-with-video.mdx): Messenger and Telegram like applications feature Chat as a primary source of communication, with Video being secondary. To build a similar app, folllow our Chat + Video guide that provides you with a template project to kick start your app, with all the UI and setup pre-baked.
* [Video + Chat](../02-guides/07-video-with-chat.mdx): If you're building a Meeting based app, like Zoom or Google Meet, then the Video + Chat guide is for you. It provides you with a template project that pre-bakes all the UI and SDK setup, so you can focus on what matters.
* [Audio Rooms](../02-guides/08-audio-rooms.mdx): Some apps feature live audio rooms where people gather to discuss ideas and fun topics. Apps like Twitter Spaces are popular and you can build them using our Audio Rooms guide. It also prepares a template project for you that cuts the time you need to start working on your app.
* [Livestream](../02-guides/09-livestream.mdx): Last, but not least, our Livestream guide teaches you how to build an app where one person streams their tracks to a group of people in real time. By the end of the guide, you'll have a project that prepares most of the setup for you.
