### Add Stream's Video SDK and it's peer dependencies

Install Stream's Video SDK and it's peer dependencies

```bash
yarn add stream-video-react-native react-native-webrtc react-native-callkeep
react-native-incall-manager react-native-svg text-encoding-polyfill
```

Some dependencies require us to make changes to our application for all functionalities to be available. Please apply the following steps:

- `react-native-webrtc` installation on [Android](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-webrtc/blob/master/Documentation/AndroidInstallation.md) and [iOS](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-webrtc/blob/master/Documentation/iOSInstallation.md).
- `react-native-svg` be aware of [compatibility](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg#supported-react-native-versions) with RN versions and [troubleshooting](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg#troubleshooting) steps.
- `react-native-incall-manager` installation on [Android](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-incall-manager#android) and [iOS](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-incall-manager#ios).
- `react-native-callkeep` installation on [Android](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-callkeep/blob/master/docs/android-installation.md) and [iOS](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-callkeep/blob/master/docs/ios-installation.md).

So what did we install precisely?

- `stream-video-react-native` (SVRN) is Stream's Video SDK which contains UI components, hooks and util functions that will enable audio/video calls.
- `react-native-webrtc` is a WebRTC module for React Native, SVRN depends on this dependency, it's components and utilities to render audio/video tracks and intract with the phone's media devices.
- `react-native-incall-manager` handles media-routes/sensors/events during a audio/video call.
- `react-native-callkeep` utilises CallKit (iOS) and ConnectionService (Android). SVRN's uses this dependency to render native ringers and handle accepting/declining a call when the app is in background/dead mode.
- `react-native-svg` provides SVG support to React Native, SVRN's components and it's icons are reliant on this dependency.


### First things first: encoding, polyfills and globals config

Add the following imports and statements to your `index.js` file in the project's root.

```tsx
/** URL polyfill */
import 'text-encoding-polyfill';
/** Text decoder polyfill */
import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto';
/** crypto.getRandomValues polyfill for uuid */
import 'react-native-get-random-values';
import {registerGlobals} from 'react-native-webrtc';
...

// We're registering globals, because our video JS client is serving SDKs that use browser based webRTC functions.
// This will result in creation of 2 global objects: `window` and `navigator`
// Further [reading](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-webrtc/blob/16cff1523da457dbcc27bb0744ee2bad3a987c41/Documentation/BasicUsage.md#registering-globals) about this process
if (Platform.OS !== 'web') {
  registerGlobals();
}
```

Follow this [guide](05-advanced/02-push-notification/01-overview.mdx)

### Versioning

Our Stream Video JS libraries do **not** follow semantic versioning.

We increase the minor version whenever breaking changes are introduced. Patch releases only contain smaller fixes and improvements.

You can keep track of all the changes in the Stream Video JS libraries via the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/releases), and you can also find the release notes of all past releases in our CHANGELOG (TODO create one) file. These will always highlight breaking changes.

We also maintain a separate document, DEPRECATIONS (TODO - create), which lists deprecated constructs in the SDK, with their expected time of further deprecations and eventual removal.
