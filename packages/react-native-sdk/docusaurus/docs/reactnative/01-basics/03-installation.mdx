### Prerequisites

First things first, make sure you have set up the development environment for React Native.
You can find the official guide [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

### Add Stream's Video SDK and its peer dependencies

In order to install the Stream Video SDK and all its peer dependencies run the following command in your terminal of choice:

```bash
yarn add stream-video-react-native react-native-webrtc react-native-callkeep react-native-device-info react-native-incall-manager react-native-svg text-encoding-polyfill react-native-url-polyfill react-native-get-random-values intl-pluralrules @react-native-community/netinfo @notifee/react-native
```

The following dependencies require additional configuration steps for the installation to be successful and all their functionalities to be available.
Please follow the links below to complete the installation process:

- `react-native-webrtc` installation on [Android](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-webrtc/blob/master/Documentation/AndroidInstallation.md) and [iOS](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-webrtc/blob/master/Documentation/iOSInstallation.md).
- `react-native-svg` be aware of [compatibility](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg#supported-react-native-versions) with RN versions and [troubleshooting](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg#troubleshooting) steps.
- `react-native-incall-manager` installation on [Android](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-incall-manager#android) and [iOS](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-incall-manager#ios).

So what did we install precisely?

- `stream-video-react-native` (SVRN) is Stream's Video SDK which contains UI components, hooks and util functions that will enable audio/video calls.
- `react-native-webrtc` is a WebRTC module for React Native, SVRN depends on this dependency, it's components and utilities to render audio/video tracks and interact with the phone's media devices.
- `react-native-device-info` is responsible for get the device info in which the SDK is used and send it to the client.
- `react-native-incall-manager` handles media-routes/sensors/events during a audio/video call.
- `react-native-svg` provides SVG support to React Native, SVRN's components and it's icons are reliant on this dependency.
- `text-encoding-polyfill` is an implementation of the WHATWG URL Standard optimized for React Native
- `react-native-url-polyfill` is a polyfill for the Encoding Living Standard API for the Web, allowing encoding and decoding of textual data to and from Typed Array buffers for binary data in JS
- `react-native-get-random-values` is used for crypto.getRandomValues polyfill to generate uuid
- `intl-pluralrules` - allows i18n with support for pluralization based on [`Intl.Plurales`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/PluralRules)
- `@react-native-community/netinfo` - is used to know the connectivity status of the device
- `@notifee/react-native` - is used to keep calls alive in the background in Android

### Optional peer dependencies

Some of the optional features we provide require additional dependencies to be installed in order to work properly.

#### Ringing flow

The ringing flow is a feature that allows you to render a native ringer when the app is in background/dead mode.
To enable this feature you need to install the following dependencies:

- `react-native-callkeep` utilises CallKit (iOS) and ConnectionService (Android). SVRN's uses this dependency to render native ringers and handle accepting/declining a call when the app is in background/dead mode.
- `@react-native-firebase/app` and `@react-native-firebase/messaging` to receive notifications on Android.
- `@react-native-voip-push-notification` to receive notifications on iOS.

More about how to enable this feature can be found [in our push notification guide](../../advanced/02-push-notifications/).

### First things first: encoding, polyfills and globals config

Add the following imports and statements to your `index.js` file in the project's root.

```tsx
/** Initialize URL polyfill */
import 'text-encoding-polyfill';
/** Initialize text decoder polyfill */
import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto';
/** Initialize polyfill for uuid */
import 'react-native-get-random-values';
/** i18next polyfill to handle intl format for pluralization. For more info see https://www.i18next.com/misc/json-format#i-18-next-json-v4 */
import 'intl-pluralrules';
import {registerGlobals} from 'react-native-webrtc';
...

// We're registering globals, because our video JS client is serving SDKs that use browser based webRTC functions.
// This will result in creation of 2 global objects: `window` and `navigator`
// Further [reading](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-webrtc/blob/16cff1523da457dbcc27bb0744ee2bad3a987c41/Documentation/BasicUsage.md#registering-globals) about this process
if (Platform.OS !== 'web') {
  registerGlobals();
}
```

### Push Notifications

To enable push notifications, you need to follow the [guide](../../advanced/02-push-notifications/).

### Versioning

Our Stream Video JS libraries do **not** follow semantic versioning.

We increase the minor version whenever breaking changes are introduced. Patch releases only contain smaller fixes and improvements.

You can keep track of all the changes in the Stream Video JS libraries via the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/releases), and you can also find the release notes of all past releases in our CHANGELOG (TODO create one) file. These will always highlight breaking changes.

We also maintain a separate document, DEPRECATIONS (TODO - create), which lists deprecated constructs in the SDK, with their expected time of further deprecations and eventual removal.
