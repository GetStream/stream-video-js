## Versioning

Our Stream Video JS libraries do **not** follow semantic versioning.

We increase the minor version whenever breaking changes are introduced. Patch releases only contain smaller fixes and improvements.

You can keep track of all the changes in the Stream Video JS libraries via the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/releases), and you can also find the release notes of all past releases in our CHANGELOG (TODO create one) file. These will always highlight breaking changes.

We also maintain a separate document, DEPRECATIONS (TODO - create), which lists deprecated constructs in the SDK, with their expected time of further deprecations and eventual removal.
