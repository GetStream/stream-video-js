The core of Stream Video for React Native is it's ability to be customized to your needs.
The new `Global Config` feature allows you to enable and disable features of the library and alter the default behavior of the SDK.

We will be gradually adding more features/options to the global config.

## When to use a Global Config

When you want to alter the default behavior of the SDK or it's components.
Please check the available options below to see if there is a config option that fits your needs.

## How to use and alter the global config

Altering the global config can be done by calling the `setConfig` function on the `StreamVideoRN` object.
Make sure to call this function before any other components are rendered at the root of your application (App.tsx in most cases).

```tsx
import { StreamVideoRN } from '@stream-io/video-react-native-sdk';

StreamVideoRN.setConfig({
  onOpenCallParticipantsInfoView: () => console.log('Open Participants View.'),
  // future config options
});
```
