The [Stream Video React Native SDK](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js) enables you to easily build any type of Video and Audio call experiences in your React Native apps.

> **Note**: The fastest way to get started with the SDK is by trying the [React Native Video Tutorial](01-tutorial.mdx). You'll learn everything about setting up the SDK and starting a video call with other people there.

The **Basics** section provides an overview of the SDK, explains the basic concepts, and shows you how to get started with building video features.

The **Client** section contains information about core components you'll use to access the low level APIs, such as the main `StreamVideo` client as well as the underlying `CallClient` which handles user tracks and media devices.

The **UI** section describes the ready-to-use React Native components provided by the SDK, we showcase building blocks to help you build your application.
