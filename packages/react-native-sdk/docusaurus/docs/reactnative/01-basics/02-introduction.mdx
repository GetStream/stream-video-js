The [Stream Video React Native SDK](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js) enables you to easily build any type of Video and Audio call experiences in your React Native apps.

> **Note**: The fastest way to get started with the SDK is by trying the [React Native Video Tutorial](01-tutorial.mdx). You'll learn everything about setting up the SDK and starting a video call with other people there.

The **Basics** section provides an overview of the SDK, explains the basic concepts, and shows you how to get started with building video features.

The **Reference** section contains information about core our core modules:
- **Call** section describes the `Call` class, this object represents the active call the user is part of.
- **StreamVideoClient** section describes the `StreamVideoClient` class, which is the main entry point to the SDK. It provides methods to create and manage calls.
- **Hooks** section describes the ready-to-use React hooks provided by the React Bindings SDK. This layer severs as sugar syntax on top of the underlying `StreamVideoClient`, `stateStore`, media devices, and `Call` object and provides a more React-like experience.
- **Components** section describes the ready-to-use React Native components provided by the SDK, we showcase building blocks to help you build your application.
- **Interfaces** section describes the UI Components props.
