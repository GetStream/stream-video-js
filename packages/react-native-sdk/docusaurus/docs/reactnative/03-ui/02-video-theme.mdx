# VideoTheme

The `VideoTheme` component is a wrapper that **you should use as the root** of all Compose Components. It's used to provide the default properties that help us style the application, such as:

* **isDarkMode**: Flag that determines if the application should be themed in light or dark mode.
* **Colors**: Defines a palette of colors we support in the app. These are applied to all components and provide us with a dark/light mode by default, but can be used to override the design system completely.
* **Dimensions**: Used for defining the dimensions of various components such as avatars, call controls, video overlays, etc.
* **Typography**: Used for all text elements, to apply different text styles to each component. Can be used to change the typography completely.
* **Shapes**: Defines several shapes we use across our Compose components. Can be used to change the shape of avatars, dialogs, call controls, etc.

## Customization

To customize the `VideoTheme`, simply override any of the default properties by passing in your custom design style, like so:

[//]: # (todo:add code snippet)

<!-- TODO add a customized screenshot -->
<!-- []() -->

<!-- TODO describe the customization -->

### StreamColors

`StreamColors` are used to represent all the colors we use and apply to our components in the SDK.

You can also browse which components are using the colors, to know what will be affected by any change.

### StreamDimensions

`StreamDimensions` defines different sizes that can be customized in the SDK.

You can find the definitions of all the dimensions we expose in the //todo: add link, as well as what the default dimensions are.

You can also browse which components are using the dimensions, to know what will be affected by any change.

### StreamTypography

`StreamTypography` is used to apply different font weights and sizes to our textual UI components.

You can find all the text style properties we expose in the //todo: add link, as well as what the default styles are.

You can also browse which components are using the styles, to know what will be affected by any change.

### StreamShapes

`StreamShapes` provides a small collection of shapes that let us style our containers.

You can find all the shapes we expose in the //todo: add link, as well as what the default shapes are.

These are really easy to customize, as you've seen before, and can make your app feel closer to your design system.
