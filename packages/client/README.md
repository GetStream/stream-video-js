# @stream-io/video-client

This package holds the autogenerated Protobuf code and clients.

## Generate the client
1. Make sure all dependencies are installed by running `yarn install`
2. Run `git submodule update --remote` (will pull the latest revision of the currently tracked branch - `master`)
3. Run `./generate-client.sh`

## Generate the client from specific .proto files revision
Master `.proto` files live into other repository ([GetStream/video](https://github.com/getstream/video))
which currently is registered as a git submodule to this repository.

Naturally, we would like to have more fine-grained control over the version of the protobuf files
this SDK uses as `latest` might not always be stable.
1. `cd <root>/video && git checkout <revision>` where `<revision>` can be any commit hash, tag or branch
2. Make sure to commit the updated submodule pointer, otherwise, other developers will not get their submodule automatically updated.
