## Generate Coordinator Models from OpenAPI spec (Dev Mode):

We have a shell script which will generate the Coordinator models from the OpenAPI spec.
This script expects the following directory structure to be set up:

- `chat` - the `chat` repository
- `stream-video-js` - current repository
- `cd stream-video-js/packages/client && yarn generate:open-api`

## Documentation

API reference documentation can be generated using the `yarn run generate-docs:client`, 
the generated documentation will be inside the `generated-docs` folder.

To view the documentation locally, run the following in the root of the respective SDK React/React Native.
    
```bash 
yarn generate-docs
`npx stream-chat-docusaurus -s`
```
