 * - `'autoplay-blocked'` — browser refused `<audio>.play()` without a

/**
 * Detects OS-level audio-session interruption and browser autoplay blocks
 * for a call, and exposes coarse health via `audioHealth$`. Also owns the
 * recovery path for autoplay blocks via `resumeAudio()`.
 *
 * The detection pipeline merges four signal sources:
 *
 * 1. The {@link HOST_AUDIO_SESSION_EVENT} host bridge (iOS WebView
 *    embedders only) — ground truth from native `AVAudioSession`
 *    notifications. `interruption.type === 'began'` → unhealthy,
 *    otherwise → healthy. Beats the in-page W3C signal when both are
 *    available (the host sees hostile category/mode changes WebKit
 *    silently ignores). See `HostAudioSessionEvent` in `./types` for the
 *    protocol contract.
 * 2. `navigator.audioSession.state` transitions (Safari 16.4+) — the
 *    primary in-page signal. `'interrupted'` → unhealthy, `'active'` →
 *    healthy.
 * 3. A probe `AudioContext` kept alive by a silent `ConstantSourceNode`
 *    so `AudioContext.state === 'interrupted'` fires reliably even on
 *    pages using `<audio srcObject>` rendering with no other AudioContext.
 *    Acts as a redundant check for (2) on Safari.
 * 4. The set of `<audio>` elements that hit a browser autoplay block
 *    (`NotAllowedError` on `.play()`). Registered by `DynascaleManager`'s
 *    `bindAudioElement` via `registerBlockedAudioElement()`; cleared on
 *    `unregisterBlockedAudioElement()` or a successful `resumeAudio()`.
 *
 * Also writes `navigator.audioSession.type = 'play-and-record'` on
 * `start()` (snapshotting the previous value) to hint WebKit towards the
 * WebRTC-friendly `AVAudioSession` category. `stop()` restores the
 * snapshot so the host page returns to its original preference.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 * - `start()` is idempotent. Must be called when a call becomes active
 *   (typically from `DynascaleManager.setSfuClient(truthy)`); calling it
 *   before a call joins would mutate page-global audio state
 *   unnecessarily.
 * - `stop()` is idempotent. Removes listeners, closes the probe context,
 *   restores `audioSession.type`, clears the blocked-elements set, and
 *   resets `audioHealth$` to `{ status: 'unknown', reason: 'not-started' }`.
 * - `setSfuClient(undefined)` in the owner is deliberately NOT a stop
 *   trigger: transient SFU disconnects during reconnection/migration must
 *   not thrash the probe.
 *
 * TODO (chrome-coverage): the current signal set is Safari-biased. On
 * Chrome/Firefox `audioHealth$` can only flip `unhealthy` via
 * `autoplay-blocked`; OS-level interruption and positive-healthy signals
 * don't exist on those browsers. Two browser-agnostic signals were
 * deferred from the original detection plan and should be added here as
 * new `AudioHealthReason` values, mirroring the `autoplay-blocked`
 * pattern (internal subject + register/unregister methods called by the
 * owner, reducer reads via `.getValue()`).
 *
 * 1. **`MediaStreamTrack.muted === true` aggregated across all remote
 *    audio tracks.** Chrome/Firefox surface pipeline/hardware-level
 *    interruption via `'mute'` / `'unmute'` events on the track — iOS
 *    Safari uses this too when a different app takes the mic.
 *    - *Integration point:* `Subscriber.handleOnTrack()`
 *      (`packages/client/src/rtc/Subscriber.ts:83–94`) already attaches
 *      `mute`/`unmute`/`ended` listeners and only logs. Extend those
 *      listeners to call a new public monitor method like
 *      `registerRemoteTrack(track)` / `unregisterRemoteTrack(track)`.
 *      `Call.ts` already threads `dynascaleManager` to Subscriber — use
 *      an optional callback in `BasePeerConnectionOpts`, same pattern as
 *      other Subscriber-side callbacks.
 *    - *Aggregation:* "**all** remote audio tracks muted" → unhealthy,
 *      not "any" — a single track muting is usually a per-sender
 *      SFU/network issue, not a client-side audio interruption. An
 *      OS-level interruption takes out the whole audio unit, so every
 *      remote track goes muted simultaneously.
 *    - *`muted` vs `enabled`:* key on `track.muted` (browser/OS-imposed)
 *      only. `track.enabled === false` is user-toggled intentional
 *      silence and must NOT flip health.
 *    - *Edge case:* a remote participant leaving while muted — recompute
 *      "all muted?" from the remaining tracks so a single remaining
 *      unmuted track clears the signal.
 *    - *New reason code:* `'remote-tracks-muted'`.
 *
 * 2. **`HTMLMediaElement.paused === true` with a live `MediaStream`
 *    `srcObject`.** Strong signal that the browser auto-paused a
 *    render-side element (OS interruption, tab backgrounded, or element
 *    hit a stall).
 *    - *Integration point:* `AudioBindingsWatchdog.register()`
 *      (`packages/client/src/helpers/AudioBindingsWatchdog.ts`) already
 *      holds a map of bound elements. Extend it to install `pause`/`play`
 *      listeners and forward paused-state changes to the monitor via
 *      another new public method pair (`registerPausedAudioElement` /
 *      `unregisterPausedAudioElement`).
 *    - *Guard conditions:* only flag when `element.srcObject` is a live
 *      `MediaStream` AND the stream has at least one `live` track.
 *      Ignores benign pauses: `srcObject = null` on unbind,
 *      user-initiated `audio.pause()`, natural end-of-stream.
 *    - *Aggregation:* "**any** bound element paused under the above
 *      conditions" is enough — the user would hear the gap.
 *    - *New reason code:* `'element-paused'`.
 *
 * Both new signals feed `computeAudioHealthInfo()` at the same priority
 * tier as `autoplay-blocked` (after `*-interrupted`, before the healthy
 * check). Once added, promote Chrome/Firefox from
 * `{ 'unknown', 'unsupported' }` to `{ 'healthy', 'playback-verified' }`
 * in the fallback branch when at least one remote track is known to be
 * unmuted AND no bound element is paused AND the monitor is started.
 *
 * Tests to add when shipping (mirror existing patterns in
 * `AudioHealthMonitor.test.ts`):
 * - `registerRemoteTrack` + all tracks muted → `remote-tracks-muted`.
 * - Single track muted out of N → stays healthy (aggregation correctness).
 * - `track.enabled = false` does NOT flip health (user-mute ignored).
 * - `registerPausedAudioElement` with live stream → `element-paused`.
 * - `srcObject = null` path is a no-op (benign-pause filter).
 * - Priority: `*-interrupted` still wins over both new reasons.
 *
 * Out of scope for chrome-coverage and deferred again:
 * - Local mic / Publisher-side mute signal — duplicates what the probe +
 *   `audioSession` already report for solo calls and adds risk to the
 *   concurrency-sensitive Publisher transceiver cache.
 * - React Native parity — RN surfaces interruption through the native
 *   bridge, not `MediaStreamTrack` / `HTMLMediaElement`. Separate plan.
