If you want to see the device management API in action, you can check out [the sample app](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/tree/main/sample-apps/client/ts-quickstart).

## Camera management

### Start-stop camera

```typescript
call.camera.toggle();

// or
call.camera.enable();
call.camera.disable();
```

Here is how you can access the status:

```typescript
call.camera.state.status; // enabled, disabled or undefined
call.camera.state.status$.subscribe(console.log); // Reactive value for status, you can subscribe to changes
```

The initial status of the camera is `undefined`. If you don't change the initial status, the default backend settings will be applied once the participant joins the call.

If you're building a lobby screen, this is how you can apply the backend settings:

```typescript
await call.get();
const defaultCameraStatus = call.state.settings?.video.camera_default_on;
defaultCameraStatus ? call.camera.enable() : call.camera.disable();
```

### List and select devices

```typescript
// List devices
// The error handler is called if the user denies permission to use camera
call.camera
  .listDevices()
  .subscribe({ next: console.log, error: console.error });

// Select device
call.camera.select('device Id');
```

Here is how you can access the selected device:

```typescript
call.camera.state.selectedDevice; // currently selected camera
call.camera.state.selectedDevice$.subscribe(console.log); // Reactive value for selected device, you can subscribe to changes
```

### Camera permissions

In a browser, you can use the following API to check whether the user has granted permission to access the connected cameras:

```typescript
call.camera.state.hasBrowserPermission$.subscribe((value) => {
  if (value) {
    // User has granted permission
  } else {
    // User has denied or not yet granted permission
  }
});
```

### Camera direction

On mobile devices it's useful if users can switch between the front and back cameras:

```typescript
await call.camera.selectDirection('front'); // or back

// Flip camera
await call.camera.flip();
```

This is how you can access the camera direction:

```typescript
call.camera.state.direction; // front, back or undefined
call.camera.state.direction$.subscribe(console.log); // Reactive value for direction, you can subscribe to changes
```

The initial direction of the camera is `undefined`. If you don't change the initial status, the default backend settings will be applied once the participant joins the call.

If you're building a lobby screen, this is how you can apply the backend settings:

```typescript
await call.get();
// fallback in case no backend setting
let defaultDirection: CameraDirection = 'front';
const backendSetting = call.state.settings?.video.camera_facing;
if (backendSetting) {
  defaultDirection = backendSetting === 'front' ? 'front' : 'back';
}
call.camera.selectDirection(defaultDirection);
```

### Render video

#### In call

Follow our [Playing Video and Audio guide](../../guides/playing-video-and-audio/).

#### Lobby preview

This is how you can show a preview video before joining the call:

```typescript
const call = client.call('default', '123');

await call.camera.enable();
const videoEl = document.createElement('video');
videoEl.playsInline = true;
videoEl.muted = true;
videoEl.autoplay = true;

if (videoEl.srcObject !== call.camera.state.mediaStream) {
  videoEl.srcObject = call.camera.state.mediaStream || null;
  if (videoEl.srcObject) {
    videoEl.play();
  }
}
```

## Microphone management

### Start-stop microphone

```typescript
call.microphone.toggle();

// or
call.microphone.enable();
call.microphone.disable();
```

This is how you can access the microphone status:

```typescript
call.microphone.state.status; // enabled, disabled or undefined
call.microphone.state.status$.subscribe(console.log); // Reactive value for status, you can subscribe to changes
```

The initial status of the microphone is `undefined`. If you don't change the initial status, the default backend settings will be applied once the participant joins the call.

If you're building a lobby screen, this is how you can apply the backend settings:

```typescript
await call.get();
const defaultMicStatus = call.state.settings?.audio.mic_default_on;
if (defaultMicStatus) {
  call.microphone.enable();
} else {
  call.microphone.disable();
}
```

### List and select devices

```typescript
// List devices
// The error handler is called if the user denies permission to use microphone
call.microphone
  .listDevices()
  .subscribe({ next: console.log, error: console.error });

// Select device
call.microphone.select('device Id');
```

This is how you can access the selected device:

```typescript
call.microphone.state.selectedDevice; // currently selected microphone
call.microphone.state.selectedDevice$.subscribe(console.log); // Reactive value for selected device, you can subscribe to changes
```

### Microphone permissions

In a browser, you can use the following API to check whether the user has granted permission to access the connected microphones:

```typescript
call.microphone.state.hasBrowserPermission$.subscribe((value) => {
  if (value) {
    // User has granted permission
  } else {
    // User has denied or not yet granted permission
  }
});
```

### Play audio

#### In call

Follow our [Playing Video and Audio guide](../../guides/playing-video-and-audio/).

#### Lobby preview

On lobby screens a common UX pattern is to show a visual indicator of the detected audio levels coming from the selected microphone. The client exposes the `createSoundDetector` utility method to help implement this functionality. Here is an example of how you can do that:

```html
<progress id="volume" max="100" min="0"></progress>
```

```typescript
import { createSoundDetector } from '@stream-io/video-client';

let cleanup: Function | undefined;
call.microphone.state.mediaStream$.subscribe(async (mediaStream) => {
  const progressBar = document.getElementById('volume') as HTMLProgressElement;
  if (mediaStream) {
    cleanup = createSoundDetector(
      mediaStream,
      (event) => {
        progressBar.value = event.audioLevel;
      },
      { detectionFrequencyInMs: 100 },
    );
  } else {
    await cleanup?.();
    progressBar.value = 0;
  }
});
```

### Speaking while muted notification

When the microphone is disabled, the client will automatically start monitoring audio levels, to detect if the user is speaking.

This is how you can subscribe to these notifications:

```typescript
call.microphone.state.speakingWhileMuted; // current value
call.microphone.state.speakingWhileMuted$.subscribe((isSpeaking) => {
  if (isSpeaking) {
    console.log(`You're muted, unmute yourself to speak`);
  }
}); // Reactive value
```

The notification is automatically disabled if the user doesn't have the permission to send audio.

## Speaker management

### List and select devices

#### Browser support

Selecting audio output device [isn't supported by all browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/sinkId), this is how you can check the availability:

```typescript
call.speaker.state.isDeviceSelectionSupported;
```

```typescript
// List devices
// The error handler is called if the user denies permission to use audio
call.speaker.listDevices().subscribe({
  next: (devices) => console.log(devices),
  error: (err) => console.error(err),
});

// Select device
call.speaker.select('device Id');
```

Device id can also be an empty string, that means to use the system's default audio output.

Here is how you can access the selected device:

```typescript
call.speaker.state.selectedDevice; // currently selected audio output
// Reactive value for selected device, you can subscribe to changes
call.speaker.state.selectedDevice$.subscribe((selectedDevice) => {
  console.log(selectedDevice);
});
```

### Set volume

Volume has to be a number between 0 and 1. 0 means mute the audio output.

```typescript
call.speaker.setVolume(0.5);
```

The default system value is 1.

Here is how you can access the selected device:

```typescript
call.speaker.state.volume; // current volume
// Reactive value for volume, you can subscribe to changes
call.speaker.state.volume$.subscribe((volume) => {
  console.log(volume);
});
```
