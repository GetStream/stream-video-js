title: Call & Participant State
description: How the state is exposed
---

The call, participant and client states are reactive. Their value is updated on WebSocket events and API calls. We use the [RxJS library](https://rxjs.dev/) for this, each state property is an Observable.

Let's see an example, this is how you can subscribe to changes related to participants:

```typescript
call.state.participants$.subscribe((participants) => console.log(participants));
```

The `console.log` method will be called each time there is a change to the list of participants in the call.

This approach makes it possible to access the state and be notified about changes anywhere in your application without having to manually subscribe to WebSocket events.

Alternatively you can also access the current value of each state variable:

```typescript
console.log(call.state.participants);
```

It's useful when you need to know the current value, but you don't need to be notified about future changes.

## Call state

The call state can be accessed by `call.state`.

Here are all the call state properties:

| Reactive value           | Static value            | Description                                                                                                  |
