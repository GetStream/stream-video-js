description: How custom events work
---

You can use custom events to send data among the participants in the call.
This is a realtime layer that you can use to broadcast your own events to.

## Sending custom events

For example, if you are building a collaborative drawing app, you can send the coordinates to the other participants with the following code:

```typescript
await call.sendCustomEvent({
  type: 'draw',
  x: 10,
  y: 30,
});
```

Please note that the total payload for these events is limited to 5KB in size.

## Receiving custom events

Custom events are only delivered to clients that are [watching the call](../../advanced/events/#call-events).

To receive custom events, you need to subscribe to the `custom` event on the call instance:

```typescript
const unsubscribe = call.on('custom', (event: CustomVideoEvent) => {
  const payload = event.custom;
  if (payload.type === 'draw') {
    console.log(`Received draw event: x=${payload.x}, y=${payload.y}`);
  }
});

// Unsubscribe when you no longer need to listen to custom events
unsubscribe();
```

For more information, check out our [Events guide](../../advanced/events).
