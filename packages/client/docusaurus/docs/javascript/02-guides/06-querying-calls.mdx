For many video calling, live stream, or audio rooms apps, you'll want to show:

- Upcoming calls
- Calls that are currently live
- Popular live streams / audio rooms with a link to the recording

The client makes it easy to query calls.

## Sorting

Sorting is supported on these fields below:

| Field        | Description                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `starts_at`  | When the call starts at                                 |
| `created_at` | When the call was created                               |
| `updated_at` | When the call was updated                               |
| `ended_at`   | When the call ended                                     |
| `type`       | The call type. Typically `default`, `livestream` etc... |
| `id`         | The id for this call                                    |
| `cid`        | The cid for this call. IE: `default:123`                |

```typescript
import { StreamVideoClient } from '@stream-io/video-client';

let client: StreamVideoClient;

await client.queryCalls({
  sort: [{ field: 'starts_at', direction: -1 }],
  limit: 10,
  watch: true,
});
```

It's possible to provide multiple sort parameters:

```typescript
import { StreamVideoClient } from '@stream-io/video-client';

let client: StreamVideoClient;

await client.queryCalls({
  sort: [
    { field: 'starts_at', direction: -1 },
    { field: 'created_at', direction: 1 },
  ],
  limit: 10,
  watch: true,
});
```

## Filters

You can filter on the following fields:

| Field                | Description                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                 | The id for this call                                          |
| `cid`                | The cid for this call. IE: `default:123`                      |
| `team`               | The team id for the call.                                     |
| `type`               | The call type. Typically `default`, `livestream` etc...       |
| `created_by_user_id` | The user id who created the call                              |
| `created_at`         | When the call was created                                     |
| `updated_at`         | When the call was updated                                     |
| `ended_at`           | When the call ended                                           |
| `starts_at`          | When the call starts at                                       |
| `backstage`          | If the call is in backstage mode or not                       |
| `members`            | Check if the call has these members listed                    |
| `ongoing`            | Check if the call is ongoing or not                           |
| `custom`             | You can query custom data using the `"custom.myfield"` syntax |

Filter expressions support multiple match criteria, and it's also possible to combine filters.
For more information, visit the [filter operators guide](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/react/query_syntax_operators/?language=javascript).

Here are some example filters:

### Calls that are about to start

```typescript
import { StreamVideoClient } from '@stream-io/video-client';

let client: StreamVideoClient;

const inNext30mins = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 30;
await client.queryCalls({
  filter_conditions: {
    starts_at: {
      $gt: new Date(Date.now() + inNext30mins).toISOString(),
    },
  },
  sort: [{ field: 'starts_at', direction: -1 }],
  limit: 10,
  watch: true,
});
```

### Call filters on a custom property

```typescript
import { StreamVideoClient } from '@stream-io/video-client';

let client: StreamVideoClient;

await client.queryCalls({
  filter_conditions: { 'custom.color': 'red' },
  limit: 10,
  watch: true,
});
```

### Calls that live / currently have participants

```typescript
import { StreamVideoClient } from '@stream-io/video-client';

let client: StreamVideoClient;

await client.queryCalls({
  filter_conditions: { ongoing: true },
});
```

### Calls the user has created or is a member of

```typescript
import { StreamVideoClient } from '@stream-io/video-client';

let client: StreamVideoClient;

await client.queryCalls({
  filter_conditions: {
    $or: [
      { created_by_user_id: '<user id>' },
      { members: { $in: ['<user id>'] } },
    ],
  },
  limit: 10,
  watch: true,
});
```

## Watching calls

If you specify `watch: true` as an option, the SDK will create a subscription to the call data on the server and you'll be able to receive updates in real-time.

The server will send updates to the client when the call data changes
(for example, members are updated, a call session has started, etc...).
This is useful for showing a live preview of who is in the call or building a call dashboard.

## Pagination

You can specify the page size using the `limit` option. The API response will include links to the previous/next pages. The following code example shows how pagination works:

```typescript
import { StreamVideoClient } from '@stream-io/video-client';

let client: StreamVideoClient;

const inNext30mins = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 30;
const callQuery = {
  filter_conditions: {
    starts_at: {
      $gt: new Date(Date.now() + inNext30mins).toISOString(),
    },
  },
  sort: [{ field: 'starts_at', direction: -1 }],
  limit: 10,
  watch: true,
};
const response = await client.queryCalls(callQuery);

// Go to next page
await client.queryCalls({ ...callQuery, next: response.next });

// Go to prev page
await client.queryCalls({ ...callQuery, prev: response.prev });
```
