For many video calling, live stream, or audio rooms apps, you'll want to show:

- Upcoming calls
- Calls that are currently live
- Popular live streams / audio rooms with a link to the recording

The client makes it easy to query calls.

## Sorting

Sorting is supported on these fields below:

- `starts_at`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`
- `ended_at`
- `type`
- `id`
- `cid`

```typescript
let client: StreamVideoClient;

client.queryCalls({
  sort: [{ field: 'starts_at', direction: -1 }],
  limit: 10,
  watch: true,
});
```

It's possible to provide multiple sort parameters:

```typescript
let client: StreamVideoClient;

client.queryCalls({
  sort: [
    { field: 'starts_at', direction: -1 },
    { field: 'created_at', direction: 1 },
  ],
  limit: 10,
  watch: true,
});
```

## Filters

You can filter on the following fields

| Option               | Description                                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`               | The call type. Typically default, livestream etc            |
| `id`                 | The id for this call                                        |
| `cid`                | The cid for this call. IE default:123                       |
| `created_by_user_id` | The user id who created the call                            |
| `created_at`         | When the call was created                                   |
| `updated_at`         | When the call was updated                                   |
| `starts_at`          | When the call starts at                                     |
| `ended_at`           | When the call ended                                         |
| `backstage`          | If the call is in backstage mode or not                     |
| `members`            | Check if you are a member of this call                      |
| `custom`             | You can query custom data using the "custom.myfield" syntax |

Filter expressions support multiple match criteria and it's also possible to combine filters. For more information visit the [filter operators guide](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/ios-swift/query_syntax_operators/?language=swift&q=filter).

Here are some example filters:

**Calls that are about to start**

```typescript
let client: StreamVideoClient;

const inNext30mins = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 30;
client.queryCalls({
  filter_conditions: {
    starts_at: {
      $gt: new Date(Date.now() + inNext30mins).toISOString(),
    },
  },
  sort: [{ field: 'starts_at', direction: -1 }],
  limit: 10,
  watch: true,
});
```

**Call filters on a custom property**

```typescript
let client: StreamVideoClient;

client.queryCalls({
  filter_conditions: {
    'custom.color': 'red',
  },
  limit: 10,
  watch: true,
});
```

**Calls that live / currently have participants**

```typescript
TODO;
```

** Calls the user has created or is a member of **

```typescript
let client: StreamVideoClient;

client.queryCalls({
  filter_conditions: {
    $or: [
      {
        created_by_user_id: '<user id>',
      },
      {
        members: { $in: ['<user id>'] },
      },
    ],
  },
  limit: 10,
  watch: true,
});
```

## Watching calls

If you specify `watch: true` the SDK will automatically keep the data about these calls updated.
This allows you to show a live preview of who's in the call.

## Pagination

You can specify the page size using the `limit` option. The API response will include links to the previous/next pages. The following code example shows how pagination works:

```typescript
let client: StreamVideoClient;

const inNext30mins = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 30;
const callQuery = {
  filter_conditions: {
    starts_at: {
      $gt: new Date(Date.now() + inNext30mins).toISOString(),
    },
  },
  sort: [{ field: 'starts_at', direction: -1 }],
  limit: 10,
  watch: true,
};
const response = await client.queryCalls(callQuery);

// Go to next page
client.queryCalls({ ...callQuery, next: response.next });

// Go to prev page
client.queryCalls({ ...callQuery, prev: response.prev });
```
