Our Video SDK provides an API for collecting this feedback which later can be seen in the call stats section of our dashboard.
It is a good practice to ask your end users about their overall experience after the end of the call or, while being in a call.

## Submit Feedback API

```ts
import { Call } from '@stream-io/video-client';

let call: Call;
await call.submitFeedback(
  rating, // a rating grade from 1 to 5,
  {
    reason, // the main feedback
    custom: {
      // ... any extra properties that you wish to collect
    },
  },
);
```
