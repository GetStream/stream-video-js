description: How reactions and custom events work
---

Reactions allow call participants to send emojis in real-time.

Custom events let participants send and receive arbitrary WebSocket messages. For example, if you want to implement a drawing feature in your call, you can use custom events for synchronizing the drawing board between participants.

## Reactions

### Sending reactions

You can send a reaction using the `sendReaction` method of a `Call` instance.

```typescript
const call: Call;

call.sendReaction({ type: 'raised-hand' });
```

The value of the `type` attribute can be any string.

It's also possible to provide additional data for the reaction:

```typescript
const call: Call;

call.sendReaction({
  type: 'raised-hand',
  emoji_code: ':raise-hand:',
  custom: { clearAfterTimeout: true },
});
```

The `emoji_code` attribute is used by the SDK components to decide which emoji to display on the UI.

The `custom` property can contain any data.

### Receiving reactions

Reactions are only delivered to clients that are [watching the call](../../advanced/events/#call-events).

The [participant state](../../guides/call-and-participant-state/#observe-participant-state) will contain the latest reaction of each participant:

```typescript
const participants = call.state.participants;
// or subscribe to call.state.participants$

const reactions = participants.map((p) => p.reaction);
```

### Clearing reactions

If you're using the [participant state](../../guides/call-and-participant-state/#observe-participant-state) for receiving reactions, you can also clear the latest reaction using the `resetReaction` method:

```typescript
const participants = call.state.participants;
// or subscribe to call.state.participants$

call.resetReaction(participants[0].sessionId);
```

This is a local action, it won't send any WebSocket messages. It's helpful if you only want to display reactions for a set period of time.

## Custom events

### Sending custom events

You can use the `sendCustomEvent` method of the `Call` instance to send custom events:

```typescript
const call: Call;

call.sendCustomEvent({
  type: 'draw',
  x: 10,
  y: 30,
});
```

The `custom` property can contain any data.

### Receiving custom events

Custom events are only delivered to clients that are [watching the call](../../advanced/events/#call-events).

To receive custom events, you need to subscribe to the `custom` WebSocket event:

```typescript
const call: Call;

call.on('custom', (event: StreamCallEvent) => {
  if (event.type === 'custom') {
    console.log(`Custom event: ${event.custom.type}`);
  }
});
```
