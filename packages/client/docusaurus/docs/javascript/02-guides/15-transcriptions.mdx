# Transcriptions

Enabling your application to provide a transcript for a call can be beneficial for your users. We understand, though, that this can be a challenging feature to implement/support.

This is why, the Stream Video SDK comes with out of the box Transcription support that you can easily manage.

The `Call` object provides a few levels of control. The first one is in the `call.state.settings.transcription` where you can find settings related to transcription, as they have been configured from the dashboard.
The `mode` property defines the feature's availability with:

- `available`: the feature is available for your call and can be enabled.
- `disabled`: the feature is not available for your call. In this case, it's a good idea to "hide" any UI element you have related to transcription.
- `auto-on`: the feature is available, and it will be enabled automatically, once the user is connected on the call.

The second level of control is the `call.state.transcribing` which allows you to check if the transcription is enabled at any given time.

For both of these, we expose a utility observables that we recommend you to subscribe on:

```typescript
import { Call } from '@stream-io/video-client';

let call: Call;

const unsubscribeSettings = call.state.settings$.subscribe((settings) => {
  if (!settings) return;
  const { transcription } = settings;
  // ...
});

const unsubscribeIsTranscribing = call.state.transcribing$.subscribe(
  (isTranscribing) => {
    console.log('Is transcribing', isTranscribing);
  },
);

// clean up
unsubscribeSettings();
unsubscribeIsTranscribing();
```

To enable call transcriptions you can use the following two methods:

```typescript
import { Call, TranscriptionSettingsModeEnum } from '@stream-io/video-client';

let call: Call;

const isTranscribing = call.state.transcribing;
if (
  call.state.settings?.transcriptions.mode !==
    TranscriptionSettingsModeEnum.DISABLED &&
  !isTranscribing
) {
  await call.startTranscription();
} else {
  await call.stopTranscription();
}
```
