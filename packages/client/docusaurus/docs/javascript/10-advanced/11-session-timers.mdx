title: Session Timers

A session timer allows you to limit the maximum duration of a call. The duration
[can be configured](https://getstream.io/video/docs/api/calls/#session-timers)
for all calls of a certain type, or on a per-call basis. When a session timer
reaches zero, the call automatically ends.

## Creating a call with a session timer

Let's see how to create a single call with a limited duration:

```ts
const callType = 'default';
const callId = 'test-call';

const call = client.call(callType, callId);
await call.getOrCreate({
  data: {
    settings_override: {
      limits: {
        max_duration_seconds: 3600,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

This code creates a call with a duration of 3600 seconds (1 hour) from the time
the session is starts (a participant joins the call).

After joining the call with the specified `max_duration_seconds`, you can
examine a session's `timer_ends_at` field, which provides the timestamp when the
call will end. When a call ends, all participants are removed from the call.

```ts
await call.join();
console.log(call.state.session?.timer_ends_at);
```

## Extending a call

â€‹You can also extend the duration of a call, both before or during the call. To
do that, you should use the `call.update` method:

```ts
await call.get();
// extend by 1 minute
const duration = call.state.settings?.limits.max_duration_seconds + 60;

await call.update({
  settings_override: {
    limits: {
      max_duration_seconds: duration,
    },
  },
});
```

If the call duration is extended, the `timer_ends_at` is updated to reflect this
change. Call participants will receive the `call.updated` event to notify them
about this change.
