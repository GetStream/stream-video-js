Broadcasting serves as a means of transmitting live or pre-recorded content to a wide audience.

We can choose from two approaches to broadcasting the media:

1. [HLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) - slight delay, better buffering
2. [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) - lower latency, less reliability

It is up to the integrators to decide, what approach will be used in their apps for the audience to consume the streams.

## Call type for broadcasting

Stream infrastructure recognizes few pre-built call types. Among them, the type [`livestream` type](../../guides/configuring-call-types#livestream) is the best suited for broadcasting events. When a `livestream` call is created, it is set to `backstage` mode by default.

## Starting and stopping the broadcasting

We have the following `Call` methods at our disposal to start and stop the broadcasting:

```ts
call.startHLS();
call.stopHLS();
```

Once started broadcasting, the data source URL is available through `playlist_url` property accessible through the `Call` state:

```ts
// omitted code ...
const call: Call;
// m3u8 playlist URL
const playlistUrl = call.state.egress?.hls?.playlist_url;
```

To play the video over HLS, a third-party library is required (for example [HLS.js](https://nochev.github.io/hls.js/docs/html/)).

If you want to use WebRTC based streaming, your viewers would have to follow the [join steps](../../guides/joining-and-creating-calls) discussed previously.
