description: Approaches to broadcasting
---

Broadcasting serves as a means of transmitting live or pre-recorded content to a wide audience.

We can choose from two approaches to broadcasting the media:

1. [HLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) - slight delay, better buffering
2. [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) - lower latency, less reliability

It is up to the integrators to decide, what approach will be used in their apps for the audience to consume the streams.

:::tip
We have built a [livestream app tutorial](../../tutorials/livestream) that relies on the broadcasting feature. The demo expands on how to implement both, the HLS and the WebRTC approach to streaming.

## Call type for broadcasting
Stream infrastructure recognizes few pre-built call types. Among them, the type [`livestream` type](../../guides/configuring-call-types#livestream) is the best suited for broadcasting events. When a `livestream` call is created, it is set to `backstage` mode by default.

## Starting and stopping the broadcasting
We have the following `Call` methods at our disposal to start and stop the broadcasting:

```ts
call.startBroadcasting()
call.stopBroadcasting()
```
Once started broadcasting, the data source URL is available through `playlist_url` property accessible through the `Call` state:

```ts
import { useCallMetadata } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

// omitted code ...

const YourComponent = () => {
  const metadata = useCallMetadata();
  const { playlist_url } = metadata.egress.hls;

  // omitted code ...
}

```

To play the video over HLS, a third-party library is required (for example [HLS.js](https://nochev.github.io/hls.js/docs/html/)).

:::important
In order the data to be broadcasted to the participants, the host side has to invoke `call.goLive()` alongisde `call.startBroadcasting()`.
