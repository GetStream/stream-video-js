Welcome to the Stream Video Client - a comprehensive toolkit designed to help you swiftly implement features such as video calling, audio calling, audio rooms, and livestreaming within your app. Our goal is to ensure an optimal developer experience that speeds up your development process.

Our JavaScript client comes with high-level API calls and reactive state management, making your development process seamless. Moreover, all calls are routed through Stream's global edge network, thereby ensuring lower latency and higher reliability due to proximity to end users.

It can be used with TypeScript and JavaScript as well.

If you're new to Stream Video Client, we recommend starting with the [quickstart](./basics/quickstart).

It also explains advanced features such as:

- Recording
- Broadcasting
- Requesting & Granting permissions
- Audio & Video Filters
