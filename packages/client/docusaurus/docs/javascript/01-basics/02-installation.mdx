The installation of the packages for the Stream Video JavaScript Client can be either done with `yarn` or `npm`.

We use [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) for the reactive state management, it's not necessary to install, but you will need that if you want to take advantage of the reactive state management.

For `yarn`:

```
yarn add @stream-io/video-client rxjs
```

For `npm`:

```
npm install @stream-io/video-client rxjs
```
