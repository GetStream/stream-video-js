The "Call Engine" section gives you an overview of our state management and lists all the available API operations and utility functions, hooks, and contexts.

The "Call Enginge" consists of the followings:

## `StreamVideoClient`

The main client that you initialize with a user. It lets you create, look up and join calls, as well as create a [`Call` instance](#call). It watches for WebSocket events such as having incoming calls and updates the [reactive state store](#reactive-state-store).

You can find the reference documentation of the `StreamVideoClient` class on the [StreamVideoClient page](./StreamVideoClient.md).

## `Call`

Call-specific client that you initialize when joining a call. It exposes all call related operations (such as recording a call, muting/unmuting yourself etc.). It watches for call related WebSocket events and updates the [reactive state store](#reactive-state-store).

You can find the reference documentation of the `Call` class on the [Call page](./Call.md).

## Reactive state store

Our SDK uses a design pattern that we refer to as reactive state store. The `StreamVideoClient` instance manages it's own state store and each `Call` instance has its own state store as well. The state stores are updated after each API call/WebSocket event. The reactive state store makes it possible to observe the state from anywhere in your application. You can access the state store using hooks.

- You can find a guide to our reactive state store on the [State store page](./02-state-store.mdx).
- You can find the list of state variables managed by the `StreamVideoClient` instance on the [Hooks/Client State page](./hooks.md/#client-state)
- You can find the list of state variables managed by the `Call` instances on the [Hooks/Call State page](./hooks.md/#call-state)

## Contexts

The [Contexts page](./contexts.md) lists all the built-in contexts provided by the SDK. They are categorized like this:

- [Client state](./contexts.md/#client-state) - these contexts let you access the client state store
- [Call state](./contexts.md/#call-state) - these contexts let you access the call state stores
- [Device management](./contexts.md/#device-management) - these contexts let you access audio/video devices and streams

## Hooks

The [Hooks page](./hooks.md) lists all the built-in hooks provided by the SDK. They are categorized like this:

<SDKSpecific name="reactnative">

- [Client operations](./hooks.md/#client-operations) - these hooks provide a
  higher-level abstraction over some `StreamVideoClient` functions or define
  extra operations
- [Call operations](./hooks.md/#call-operations) - these
  hooks provide a higher-level abstraction over some `Call` functions calls or
  define extra operations

</SDKSpecific>

- [Client state](./hooks.md/#client-state) - these are hooks that let you observe
  client related state variables (such as the logged in user, incoming calls etc.)
- [Call state](./hooks.md/#call-state) - these are are hooks that let you observe
  call related state variables (such as the list of participants etc.)
- [Device management](./hooks.md/#device-management) these hooks let you list and select audio and video devices, and publish audio/video
  streams
