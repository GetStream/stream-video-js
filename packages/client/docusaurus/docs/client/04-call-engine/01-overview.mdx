The "Call Engine" section lists all the available API operations and utility functions, hooks, and contexts.

The "Call Engine" consists of the following:

## StreamVideoClient

The main client that you initialize with a user. It lets you create, look up, and join calls and create a [`Call` instance](#call). It watches for WebSocket events such as incoming calls and updates the [reactive state store](#reactive-state-store).

You can find the reference documentation of the `StreamVideoClient` class on the [StreamVideoClient page](./StreamVideoClient.md).

## Call

The call-specific client that you initialize when joining a call. It exposes all call-related operations (such as recording a call, muting/unmuting yourself, etc.). It watches for call-related WebSocket events and updates the [reactive state store](#reactive-state-store).

You can find the reference documentation of the `Call` class on the [Call page](./Call.md).

## Reactive state store

Our SDK uses a design pattern that we refer to as a reactive state store. The `StreamVideoClient` instance manages its own state store and each `Call` instance has its own state store as well. The state stores are updated after each API call/WebSocket event. The reactive state store makes it possible to observe the state from anywhere in your application. You can access the state store using hooks.

- You can find a guide to our reactive state store on the [State store page](../../guides/04-state-store).
- You can find the list of state variables managed by the `StreamVideoClient` instance on the [Hooks/Client State page](./hooks-and-contexts.md/#client-state)
- You can find the list of state variables managed by the `Call` instances on the [Hooks/Call State page](./hooks-and-contexts.md/#call-state)

## Hooks and Contexts

The [Hooks and Contexts page](./hooks-and-contexts.md) lists all the built-in hooks and contexts provided by the SDK. They are categorized like this:

- [Client state](./hooks-and-contexts.md/#client-state) - these let you access the client state store
- [Call state](./hooks-and-contexts.md/#call-state) - these let you access the call state stores
- [Device management](./hooks-and-contexts.md/#device-management) - these provide high level APIs for device management

<SDKSpecific name="reactnative">

- [Client operations](./hooks-and-contexts.md/#client-operations) - these provide a
  higher-level abstraction over some `StreamVideoClient` functions or define
  extra operations
- [Call operations](./hooks-and-contexts.md/#call-operations) - these
  provide a higher-level abstraction over some `Call` functions calls or
  define extra operations
