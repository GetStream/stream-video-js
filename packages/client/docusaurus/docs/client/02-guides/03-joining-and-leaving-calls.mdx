This guide shows how to create, join, leave, and end call rooms and ring calls. To follow this guide, make sure that you have read the [call lifecycle guide](../call-lifecycle/) to understand the mental model behind the examples.

## Call room

### Create and join a call

<SDKSpecific name="react">

The easiest way to join a call is to use the `StreamMeeting` component:

```tsx
import {
  CallingState,
  useCreateStreamVideoClient,
  StreamMeeting,
  StreamVideo,
  useCall,
  useCallCallingState,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

import '@stream-io/video-react-sdk/dist/css/styles.css';

export default function App() {
  const client = useCreateStreamVideoClient({
    apiKey: '<Your API key>',
    tokenOrProvider: '<token provider>',
    user: {
      id: '<user id>',
    },
  });
  return (
    <StreamVideo client={client}>
      <StreamMeeting
        callType="default"
        callId="test-call"
        autoJoin={true}
        data={{ create: true }}
      >
        <MeetingUI />
      </StreamMeeting>
    </StreamVideo>
  );
}

const MeetingUI = () => {
  const call = useCall();
  const callingState = useCallCallingState();
  const isCallJoined = callingState === CallingState.JOINED;
  return (
    <div style={{ height: '100%' }}>
      {!call && <div>Loading...</div>}
      {call && isCallJoined && <div> Joined to call </div>}
    </div>
  );
};
```

You can configure the call using the `data` props, see below for more information on the possible options.

If you set the `autoJoin` prop to `false` the call won't be joined (nor will it be created if it's a new call).

</SDKSpecific>

This is what call join looks like under the hood:

```ts
import {
  StreamVideoClient,
  TokenOrProvider,
  User,
} from '@stream-io/video-client';

const user: User = {
  id: '<user id>'
};

const tokenProvider: TokenOrProvider = <token provider>

const videoClient = new StreamVideoClient('MY_API_KEY');
await videoClient.connectUser(user, tokenProvider);

const callType = 'default';
const callId = 'test-call';
await videoClient.call(callType, callId).join({create: true});
```

To see possible call configuration options (for example, call members), go to the [`join` method reference](../../call-engine/Call/#join).

One of the flags you can provide there is `create`. Set this to `true` if you want to enable creating new calls. Set it to `false` if you only want to allow joining existing calls.

If you don't want to join a call, just create one, you can use the `getOrCreate` method:

```typescript
const callType = 'default';
const callId = 'test-call';
await videoClient.call(callType, callId).getOrCreate();
```

To see possible call configuration options (for example, call members), go to the [`getOrCreate` method reference](../../call-engine/Call/#getorcreate).

### Leave call

To leave a call, you can use the `leave` method:

```typescript
call.leave();
```

### End call

Ending a call requires a [special permission](../../advanced/permissions-and-moderation). This action terminates the call for everyone.

```typescript
call.end();
```

Only users with special permission can join an ended call.

## Ring call

### Create call

To create a ring call, we need to set the `ring` flag to `true` and provide the list of members we want to call.

```typescript
client
  .call('default', 'test-outgoing-call')
  .getOrCreate({ ring: true, data: { members: [{ user_id: 'my friend' }] } });
```

This step will start the signaling flow.

The caller will automatically join the call once the first callee accepts the call.

The calling will automatically stop if all callee rejects the call.

### Watch for incoming and outgoing calls

<SDKSpecific name="react">

The easiest way to watch for incoming and outgoing calls is to use the [`useCalls`](../../call-engine/hooks-and-contexts/#usecalls) hook.

```tsx
import {
  CallingState,
  useCreateStreamVideoClient,
  StreamMeeting,
  StreamVideo,
  useCall,
  useCallCallingState,
  useCalls,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

export default function App() {
  const client = useCreateStreamVideoClient({
    apiKey: '<Your API key>',
    tokenOrProvider: '<token provider>',
    user: {
      id: '<user id>',
    },
  });

  return (
    <StreamVideo client={client}>
      <Calls></Calls>
    </StreamVideo>
  );
}

const Calls = () => {
  const calls = useCalls();

  return (
    <>
      {calls.map((call) => (
        // Note that we set autoJoin to false, as the joining is handled by the signal flow, it's not automatical
        <StreamMeeting call={call} autoJoin={false} key={call.cid}>
          <CallUI></CallUI>
        </StreamMeeting>
      ))}
    </>
  );
};

const CallUI = () => {
  const call = useCall();
  const callingState = useCallCallingState();
  return (
    <div style={{ height: '100%' }}>
      {!call && <div>Loading...</div>}
      {call && callingState === CallingState.JOINED && <div>Joined call</div>}
      {call && callingState === CallingState.RINGING && call.isCreatedByMe && (
        <div>
          <div>Outgoing call</div>
          <button onClick={() => call.leave()}>Cancel</button>
        </div>
      )}
      {call && callingState === CallingState.RINGING && !call.isCreatedByMe && (
        <div>
          <div>Incoming call</div>
          <button onClick={() => call.join()}>Accept</button>
          <button onClick={() => call.leave({ reject: true })}>Reject</button>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

The above code snippet will use the `useCalls` hook to display the list of incoming, outgoing, and joined calls.

For the call UI it uses the [`useCall`](../../call-engine/hooks-and-contexts/#usecall) and [`useCallCallingState`](../../call-engine/hooks-and-contexts/#usecallcallingstate) hooks to get the call instance and calling state information.

This is how the call UI works:

- for an outgoing call, it displays the "Cancel" button that can be used to stop the signaling flow (this is only possible until the first callee accepts the call)
- for an incoming call, it displays the "Accept" and "Reject" buttons for the user to decide to accept or reject the call

</SDKSpecific>

Let's see how the cancel, accept and reject operations work:

#### Canceling a call

A caller can cancel an outgoing call until the first callee accepts the call. Canceling a call will stop the signaling flow.

```typescript
call.leave();
```

Please note that calling `call.leave()` after joining the call won't stop the signaling flow.

#### Accepting a call

A callee can accept or reject an incoming call. To accept and join the call:

```typescript
call.join();
```

Please note that it's possible to join multiple calls. If you only want to allow one active call, you must leave joined calls before accepting an incoming call.

#### Rejecting a call

A callee can accept or reject an incoming call. To reject the call:

```typescript
call.leave({ reject: true });
```

#### Leave call

To leave a joined call, you can use the `leave` method:

```typescript
call.leave();
```

#### End call

Ending a call requires a [special permission](../../advanced/permissions-and-moderation). This action terminates the call for everyone.

```typescript
call.end();
```
