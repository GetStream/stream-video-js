In this cookbook, we will explore the ways to remind users they are speaking while being muted.
The React SDK bundles [`SpeakingWhileMutedNotification`](../../ui-components/utility/speaking-while-muted-notification) component, but we will discover how to build our own component.

## Speaking-while-muted notification component

Our speaking-while-muted notification component will be based on simple principle of reading the `isSpeakingWhileMuted` state of the currently selected mic.
The UI will be rendered only, when `isSpeakingWhileMuted` is set to `true`.

```tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useCallStateHooks } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

export const SpeakingWhileMutedNotification = () => {
  const { useMicrophoneState } = useCallStateHooks();
  const { isSpeakingWhileMuted } = useMicrophoneState();

  const [showNotification, setShowNotification] = useState(false);
  if (!showNotification && isSpeakingWhileMuted) {
    setShowNotification(true);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!showNotification) return;
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      setShowNotification(false);
    }, 3500);
    return () => {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
      setShowNotification(false);
    };
  }, [showNotification, 3500]);

  if (!isSpeakingWhileMuted) return null;

  return <div>You are muted</div>;
};
```
