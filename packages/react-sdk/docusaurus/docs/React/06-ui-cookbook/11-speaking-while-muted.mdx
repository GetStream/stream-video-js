In this cookbook, we will explore the ways to remind users they are speaking while being muted.
The React SDK bundles [`SpeakingWhileMutedNotification`](../../ui-components/utility/speaking-while-muted-notification) component, but we will discover how to build our own component.

## Speaking-while-muted notification component

Our speaking-while-muted notification component will be based on simple principle of reading the `isSpeakingWhileMuted` state of the currently selected mic.
The UI will be rendered only, when `isSpeakingWhileMuted` is set to `true`.

```tsx
import { useCallStateHooks } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

export const SpeakingWhileMutedNotification = () => {
  const { useMicrophoneState } = useCallStateHooks();
  const { isSpeakingWhileMuted } = useMicrophoneState();

  if (!isSpeakingWhileMuted) return null;
  return <div>You are muted</div>;
};
```
