The `VideoPlaceholder` component is a combination of elements that serves as a fallback in the absence of an active video feed. This component is conditionally rendered by the [`ParticipantView`](../../ui-components/core/participant-view) core component over the video element, learn how to customize your `ParticipantView` in [the participant view customizations guide](../../ui-cookbook/participant-view-customizations).

In this guide we'll learn how to build and implement our own primitive video placeholder component.

### Video placeholder component

```tsx
import {
  useParticipantViewContext,
  type VideoPlaceholderProps,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

const CustomVideoPlaceholder = ({
  // highlight-next-line
  style,
}: VideoPlaceholderProps) => {
  const { participant } = useParticipantViewContext();

  return (
    // highlight-next-line
    <div style={{ ...style, width: '100%', background: '#ddd' }}>
      {/* display profile picture if available */}
      {participant.image && (
        <img
          style={{ width: 100, height: 100, borderRadius: 9999 }}
          src={participant.image}
          alt={participant.id}
        />
      )}
      {/* otherwise try to display name or fallback to ID */}
      {!participant.image && <span>{participant.name || participant.id}</span>}
    </div>
  );
};
```

We've mentioned that `VideoPlaceholder` component is rendered _over the video element_. This is done so that the SDK can keep working with the same video element instance for performance reasons. As you can see, we've highlighted a few lines which are recommended way to implement our placeholder component. This extra `style` property comes from the `ParticipantView` component and currently only provides absolute positioning but this might be a subject to change so to make future updates easier, we recommend you to extend your "wrapper" element's `style` with `style` property provided by the `ParticipantView` component.

## Final steps

Now we can pass this custom `VideoPlaceholder` component down to our call layout components or directly to `ParticipantView` component in our custom call layout as described in the aforementioned [ParticipantView customizations guide](../../ui-cookbook/participant-view-customizations).
