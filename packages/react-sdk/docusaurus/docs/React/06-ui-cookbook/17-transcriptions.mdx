# Transcriptions

Enabling your application to provide a transcript for a call can be beneficial for your users. We understand, though, that this can be a challenging feature to implement/support.

This is why, the Stream React Video SDK comes with out of the box Transcription support that you can easily manage.

The `Call` object provides a few levels of control. The first one is in the `call.state.settings.transcription` where you can find settings related to transcription, as they have been configured from the dashboard.
The `mode` property defines the feature's availability with:

- `available`: the feature is available for your call and can be enabled.
- `disabled`: the feature is not available for your call. In this case, it's a good idea to "hide" any UI element you have related to transcription.
- `auto-on`: the feature is available, and it will be enabled automatically, once the user is connected on the call.

The second level of control is the `call.state.transcribing` which allows you to check if the transcription is enabled at any given time.

For both of these, we expose a utility hooks that we recommend you to use:

```typescript
import { useCallStateHooks } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

const { useCallSettings, useIsCallTranscribingInProgress } =
  useCallStateHooks();

// access to the transcription settings
const { transcription } = useCallSettings();

// whether transcription is on or off
const isTranscribing = useIsCallTranscribingInProgress();
```

With that in mind, we can build a simple UI element that will allow the user to toggle on/off the Transcription feature. The element will also take care of showing/hiding depending on the feature's availability.

```tsx
import {
  useCall,
  useCallStateHooks,
  TranscriptionSettingsModeEnum,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

export const MyToggleTranscriptionButton = () => {
  const call = useCall();
  const { useCallSettings, useIsCallTranscribingInProgress } =
    useCallStateHooks();

  const { transcription } = useCallSettings() || {};
  if (transcription?.mode === TranscriptionSettingsModeEnum.DISABLED) {
    // transcriptions are not available, render nothing
    return null;
  }

  const isTranscribing = useIsCallTranscribingInProgress();
  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        if (isTranscribing) {
          call?.stopTranscription().catch((err) => {
            console.log('Failed to stop transcriptions', err);
          });
        } else {
          call?.startTranscription().catch((err) => {
            console.error('Failed to start transcription', err);
          });
        }
      }}
    >
      {isTranscribing ? 'Stop transcription' : 'Start transcription'}
    </button>
  );
};
```
