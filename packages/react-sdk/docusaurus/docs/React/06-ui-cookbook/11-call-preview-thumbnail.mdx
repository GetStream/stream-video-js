description: Learn how to show a call preview image (thumbnail) in your app.

Depending on your call type settings, our system can occasionally generate a preview image (thumbnail) for your call.
You can use this image to show a preview of the call in your app, typically in a lobby, waiting room, etc.

## Get the preview thumbnail

```tsx
import { useCallStateHooks } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

const { useCallThumbnail } = useCallStateHooks();
const thumbnail = useCallThumbnail();

console.log(thumbnail.image_url);
```

## Show the preview thumbnail

Our React Video SDK provides a built-in component to show the preview image. You can use it like this:

```tsx
import { CallPreview } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

export const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div className="my-container">
      <CallPreview
        className="my-call-preview-class"
        style={{ width: '240px', height: '135px' }}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

Optionally, it accepts `className` and `style` props, so you can style it as you wish.
