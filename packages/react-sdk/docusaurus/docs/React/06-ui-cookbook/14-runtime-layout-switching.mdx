During your application's lifecycle there will be situations where you'll want to direct your users to a different [video layout](./04-video-layout.mdx) upon certain event. In this case we'll explore how to automatically switch to a video layout that is better suited for when any of the participants starts a screen share session.

## Defining Stage component

In this guide, we'll introduce a concept component called `Stage` that'll handle the automatic switching logic and renders appropriate layout component.

```tsx
import {
  PaginatedGridLayout,
  SpeakerLayout,
  useCallStateHooks,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

const LayoutMap = {
  Speaker: {
    component: SpeakerLayout,
    title: 'Speaker layout with spotlight',
    props: {},
  },
  PaginatedGrid: {
    component: PaginatedGridLayout,
    title: 'Paginated grid layout',
    props: {
      groupSize: 12,
    },
  },
};

export const Stage = () => {
  const [selectedLayout, setSelectedLayout] =
    useState<keyof typeof LayoutMap>('PaginatedGrid');
  const { useHasOngoingScreenshare } = useCallStateHooks();
  const hasOngoingScreenshare = useHasOngoingScreenshare();

  const LayoutComponent = LayoutMap[selectedLayout].component;
  const componentProps = LayoutMap[selectedLayout].props;

  useEffect(() => {
    // set screen share compatible layout
    if (hasOngoingScreenshare) return setSelectedLayout('Speaker');

    return setSelectedLayout('PaginatedGrid');
  }, [hasOngoingScreenshare]);

  return <LayoutComponent {...componentProps} />;
};
```

### Optional enhancements

If your application supports more than two video layouts, you might want to consider storing preferred layout in the `localStorage` so when your application toggles back - it switches to the preferred one.

Consider using versioned persisted application states like the one in [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand#persist-middleware).
