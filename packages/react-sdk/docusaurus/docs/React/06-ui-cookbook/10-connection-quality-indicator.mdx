## Introduction

Network conditions are not always perfect so instead of playing guessing games as to why is someone's video so blurry our default `ParticipantViewUI` component comes equipped with connection quality indicator which provides general information about that participants network conditions in three states:

- poor
- good
- excellent

In this guide we'll learn how to build and implement our own primitive connection quality indicator.

### How to reach the state

Each (`StreamVideoParticipant`)[TODO: link] has a `connectionQuality` property which by itself is just a numeric representation of values in a `SfuModels.ConnectionQuality` enum. To get a readable format out of it we'll just pass the `connectionQuality` variable as a key to said enum:

```tsx
import { SfuModels } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

const readableConnectionQuality =
  SfuModels.ConnectionQuality[participant.connectionQuality];

console.log(readableConnectionQuality); // -> EXCELLENT
```

### Connection quality indicator component

You'll most likely be displaying this indicator component inside each participant box ((ParticipantView)[TODO: link]) within a call layout, you can learn more about `ParticipantViewUI` customizations in [the participant view customizations guide](./14-participant-view-customizations.mdx).

```tsx
import {
  SfuModels,
  type ParticipantViewUIProps,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

const ConnectionQualityIndicator = ({
  participant,
}: ParticipantViewUIProps) => {
  const readableConnectionQuality =
    SfuModels.ConnectionQuality[participant.connectionQuality];

  return (
    <span>
      {'⭐️'.repeat(participant.connectionQuality)} - {readableConnectionQuality}
    </span>
  );
};

const CustomParticipantViewUI = ({ participant }: ParticipantViewUIProps) => (
  <>
    <ConnectionQualityIndicator participant={participant} />
    {/* other UI components... */}
  </>
);
```

## Final steps

Now we can pass this custom `ParticipantViewUI` component down to our call layout components or directly to `ParticipantView` component in our custom call layout as described in the aforementioned [participant view customizations guide](./14-participant-view-customization.mdx).
