Network conditions are not always perfect so instead of playing guessing games as to why is someone's video so blurry our default `ParticipantViewUI` component comes equipped with connection quality indicator which provides general information about that participants network conditions in four states:

- unspecified
- poor
- good
- excellent

In this guide we'll learn how to build and implement our own primitive connection quality indicator.

### How to reach the state

Each [`StreamVideoParticipant`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/blob/main/packages/client/src/types.ts) has a `connectionQuality` property which by itself is just a numeric representation of values in a `SfuModels.ConnectionQuality` enum. To get a readable format out of it we'll just pass the `connectionQuality` variable as a key to said enum:

```tsx
import { SfuModels } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

const readableConnectionQuality =
  SfuModels.ConnectionQuality[participant.connectionQuality];

console.log(readableConnectionQuality); // -> EXCELLENT
```

### Connection quality indicator component

You'll most likely be displaying this indicator component inside each participant box ([ParticipantView](../../ui-components/core/participant-view)) within a call layout, you can learn more about `ParticipantViewUI` customizations in [the participant view customizations guide](../participant-view-customizations).

```tsx
import {
  SfuModels,
  useParticipantViewContext,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

const ConnectionQualityIndicator = () => {
  const { participant } = useParticipantViewContext();

  const readableConnectionQuality =
    SfuModels.ConnectionQuality[participant.connectionQuality];

  return (
    <span title={readableConnectionQuality}>
      {'⭐️'.repeat(participant.connectionQuality)}
    </span>
  );
};

const CustomParticipantViewUI = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <ConnectionQualityIndicator />
      {/* your other custom UI elements */}
    </>
  );
};
```

## Final steps

Now we can pass this custom `ParticipantViewUI` component down to our call layout components or directly to `ParticipantView` component in our custom call layout as described in the aforementioned [ParticipantView customizations guide](../../ui-cookbook/participant-view-customizations).
