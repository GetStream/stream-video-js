In most cases, you can simply use the [reactive state store](../../guides/call-and-participant-state) to be notified about state changes.
However, for some advanced use cases, you might need to subscribe to the underlying WebSocket events.

## List of events

### Client events

Client events are always delivered if a user is connected to the client using the `connectUser` method.

The list of client events:

| Name               | Description                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `connection.ok`    | Fired when the authentication process finished successfully |
| `connection.error` | Fired when the WS connections fails                         |

### Call events

These events are related to a specific call. Some of these events are only delivered to clients that are watching the specific call. There are 3 ways to watch a call:

1. Call the `queryCalls` method with the `watch` option set to `true`:

```typescript
import { StreamVideoClient } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

let client: StreamVideoClient;

await client.queryCalls({
    ...
    watch: true
});
```

2. Join a call:

```typescript
import { StreamVideoClient } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

let client: StreamVideoClient;

const call = client.call('default', 'test-call');
await call.join();
```

3. Watch a call:

```typescript
import { StreamVideoClient } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

let client: StreamVideoClient;

await client.call('default', 'test-call').getOrCreate();
// or
await client.call('default', 'test-call').get();
```

The list of call events:

| Name                              | Description                                                    | Delivered to     |

## Listening to client and call events

You can use the `on` method of the `StreamVideoClient` instance to subscribe to client and call WebSocket events.

The `on` method takes the type of the event you want to subscribe to or the 'all' keyword indicating that you want to be notified about all events.

The event handler will receive an object with type [`StreamVideoEvent`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/blob/main/packages/client/src/coordinator/connection/types.ts) that has a `type` attribute that tells the type of the event. The available event types are described by the [`EventTypes`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/blob/main/packages/client/src/coordinator/connection/types.ts) type.

The `on` method returns a method that can be called to unsubscribe from WebSocket events.

Subscribing to all events:

```typescript
import {
  StreamVideoClient,
  StreamVideoEvent,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

let client: StreamVideoClient;

// Subscribe to all events
const unsubscribe = client.on('all', (event: StreamVideoEvent) => {
  console.log(event);
});

// Unsubscribe
unsubscribe();
```

Subscribing to `call.created` events:

```typescript
import {
  StreamVideoClient,
  StreamVideoEvent,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

let client: StreamVideoClient;

// Subscribe to all events
const unsubscribe = client.on('call.created', (event: StreamVideoEvent) => {
  if (event.type === 'call.created') {
    console.log(`Call created: ${event.call_cid}`);
  }
});

// Unsubscribe
unsubscribe();
```

## Listening to call events

You can use the `on` method of the `Call` instance to subscribe to WebSocket events belonging to a specific call.

The `on` method takes the type of the event you want to subscribe to.

The event handler will receive an object with type [`StreamCallEvent`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/blob/main/packages/client/src/coordinator/connection/types.ts) that has a `type` attribute that tells the type of the event. The available event types are described by the [`CallEventTypes`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/blob/main/packages/client/src/coordinator/connection/types.ts) type.

The `on` method returns a method that can be called to unsubscribe from WebSocket events.

Subscribing to `call.reaction_new` event.

```typescript
import { Call, StreamVideoEvent } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

let call: Call;

// Subscribe to new reactions event
const unsubscribe = call.on('call.reaction_new', (event: StreamVideoEvent) => {
  if (event.type === 'call.reaction_new') {
    console.log(`New reaction: ${event.reaction}`);
  }
});

// Unsubscribe
unsubscribe();
```
