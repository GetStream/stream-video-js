description: A list of supported platforms and SDK size information
---

Our React Video SDK can run on all modern browsers and platforms. Here is a list of supported platforms:

- Chrome 91+
- Firefox 89+
- Edge 91+
- Safari and Mobile Safari 15+

## WebView

Our SDK can run in Web View on Android and iOS. However, we recommend using the SDK in a browser for the best experience.

## SDK Size

Our SDK follows the industry standards and is optimized for tree-shaking.
Modern bundlers like Webpack and Rollup can remove the unused code from the SDK, which helps in reducing the bundle size.

The SDK size after minification is below 600KB. This size includes all the components and utilities provided by the SDK.
After g-zipping, the SDK can be compressed down to ~165KB. The actual size of the SDK in your application will depend on the components you use.

For most up-to-date information on the SDK size, please check the [package size](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@stream-io/video-react-sdk) on Bundlephobia.
