## Introduction

The Stream Video React SDK enables you to easily build any type of Video and Audio call experiences in your React apps.

The SDK allows you to build all sorts of applications that use audio and video capabilities:

- Meeting Applications: similar to popular tools, such as Zoom.
- Audio Rooms: build experiences close to Twitter Spaces or Clubhouse
- Call functionality: known from your favorite messengers that allow you to call and meet with your friends and loved ones.

These are not the only possibilities as we've built our SDK to be extremely flexible and enable you to build out the applications that you want.

## Getting started

The **Basics** section provides an overview of the SDK and shows you how to get started with building call features.

The **Guides** section provides a high-level overview of the most important concepts you need to know for building your application.

The **Video UI components** section describes the ready-to-use components provided by the SDK.

The **Call Engine** section provides a detailed description of our state management and lists all the available API operations and utility functions/hooks/contexts.

The **Advanced Guides** and **UI Cookbook** sections help you with various customization aspects.

The fastest way to get started with the SDK is by trying the [Video Tutorial](./basics/01-tutorial). You'll learn everything about setting up the SDK and starting a video call with other people there.
