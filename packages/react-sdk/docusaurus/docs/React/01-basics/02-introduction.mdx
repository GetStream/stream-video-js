The **Basics** section provides an overview of the SDK, explains the basic concepts, and shows you how to get started with building video features.

The **Reference** section contains information about core our core modules:
- **Call** section describes the `Call` class, this object represents the active call the user is part of.
- **StreamVideoClient** section describes the `StreamVideoClient` class, which is the main entry point to the SDK. It provides methods to create and manage calls.
- **Hooks** section describes the ready-to-use React hooks provided by the React Bindings SDK. This layer severs as sugar syntax on top of the underlying `StreamVideoClient`, `stateStore`, media devices, and `Call` object and provides a more React-like experience.
- **Components** section describes the ready-to-use React components provided by the SDK, we showcase building blocks to help you build your application.
