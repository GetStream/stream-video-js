Here is a list of things still to address on this page:

- Show an example of how to use one of the pre-built components
- Add more CSS theming examples

## Introduction

There are different ways to use the React Video SDK to build out UI. It comes with powerful built-in video components ready for use.
In addition, it allows for styling and custom theming options with custom CSS.

For custom use cases it is also possible to create your own components to fully tailor the SDK towards your needs. Please note that we suggest not to override a few, core components as those contain complex, low-level logic related to performance, the list of these components can be found in the [UI Components overview](../03-ui/01-overview.mdx).

This page guides you through all of them with increasing levels of customization.

## Using pre-built components

The SDK comes with a lot of pre-built components for the different elements of the UI.

:::tip
For a list of all available UI components head over to the [Components](../../ui/01-ui-overview) section.

## Theming with CSS

If you only want to customize the styling of the available components, there is a wide range of CSS variables that you can override.
With that, you can achieve a significant amount of theming in your video product.

The way this works is that there are various reserved variable names inside of our [styling package](TODO: link to styling package).
To change them you can simply override them with your custom values.

Here are a few examples:

```scss
// Change the font family (make sure to provide enough fallback fonts, though)
--str-video__font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;

// The primary color that is used
--str-video__primary-color: green;
```

There are too many variables that you can change, so here are links to the files that contain them for you to discover:

- [Global Theming](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/blob/main/packages/styling/src/_global-theme-variables.scss)
- [Global Layout](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/blob/main/packages/styling/src/_global-layout-variables.scss)
- [Color Palette](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/blob/main/packages/styling/src/_palette-variables.scss)
- [Icons and Colors](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/blob/main/packages/styling/src/_variables.scss)

## Custom components

You can create custom components from scratch or you can use built-in components as building blocks.

Here is an example of how you can use the `useParticipants()` hook to get all call participants and render them in your application.

```tsx
import { useParticipants } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

const ParticipantList = () => {
    const participants = useParticipants();

    return (
        <>
            <h2>Participants</h2>
            { participants.map((participant) => (
                <div key={participant.userId}>
                    <img src={participant.image} alt={`Profile picture of ${participant.name}.`}
                    <span>{participant.name}</span>
                </div>
            ))}
        </>
    )
}
```

:::note
A more thorough example of how to do this can be found in the [Custom Participant List](../../ui-cookbook/participant-list) guide in the UI Cookbook section.
:::

Combining all of the possibilities that you have gives you the freedom to use the performant pre-built components when they suit your needs.
At the same time if you have more customized use cases you can fully tailor the appearance to your needs.

## UI Cookbook

The [UI Cookbook section](../06-ui-cookbook/01-overview.mdx) contains tutorials with various customization examples.
