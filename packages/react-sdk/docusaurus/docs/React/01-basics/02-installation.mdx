description: Installation instructions and bundle size impact for the React Video SDK
---

The installation of the packages for the Stream Video React SDK can be either done with `yarn`, `npm` or any other package manager.

For `yarn`:

```bash
yarn add @stream-io/video-react-sdk
```

For `npm`:

```bash
npm install @stream-io/video-react-sdk
```

## SDK Size

Our SDK follows the industry standards and is optimized for tree-shaking.
Modern bundlers like Webpack and Rollup can remove the unused code from the SDK, which helps in reducing the bundle size.

The SDK size after minification is below 600KB. This size includes all the components and utilities provided by the SDK.
After g-zipping, the SDK can be compressed down to ~165KB. The actual size of the SDK in your application will depend on the components you use.

For most up-to-date information on the SDK size, please check the [package size](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@stream-io/video-react-sdk) on Bundlephobia.
