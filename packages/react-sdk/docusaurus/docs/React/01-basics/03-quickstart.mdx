This quickstart gives you a quick overview of how Stream's video SDKs work.

## Client setup & Calls

Create an instance of `StreamVideoClient` that will establish WebSocket connection by connecting a user.

Next you create a call object and join the call.
We'll specify `create: true` to create the call if it doesn't exist.

```tsx
import {
  StreamCall,
  StreamVideo,
  StreamVideoClient,
  User,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

const apiKey = 'your-api-key';
const userId = 'user-id';
const token = 'authentication-token';
const user: User = { id: userId };

const client = new StreamVideoClient({ apiKey, user, token });
const call = client.call('default', 'my-first-call');
call.join({ create: true });

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <StreamVideo client={client}>
      <StreamCall call={call}>/* My Video UI */</StreamCall>
    </StreamVideo>
  );
};
```

`default` is a call type. There are 4 built-in [call types](../../guides/configuring-call-types/) and you can also create your own. The call type controls the permissions and which features are enabled.

The second argument is the call id. Call IDs can be reused, meaning that it's possible to join a call with the same id multiple times (for example, for recurring meetings).

## Rendering video

The call's state can be accessed using hooks, all exposed through the top-level `useCallStateHooks` hook.

You'll often work with `useParticipants` hook.
Have a look below for a basic example of how to render the video of all participants:

```tsx
import { useCallStateHooks, ParticipantView } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

export const MyVideoUI = () => {
  const { useParticipants } = useCallStateHooks();
  const participants = useParticipants();
  return (
    <>
      {participants.map((p) => (
        <ParticipantView participant={p} key={p.sessionId} />
      ))}
    </>
  );
};
```

The participant object contains all essential information to render videos, such as audio/video tracks, user information, audio/video enabled, etc.
`sessionId` uniquely identifies a participant in a call.

More information about state management can be found in the [Call & Participant State guide](../../guides/call-and-participant-state).

## Camera & Microphone

Most video apps will show buttons to mute/unmute the audio or video. The example below shows how to use the camera:

```tsx
import { useCallStateHooks } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

export const MyVideoButton = () => {
  const { useCameraState } = useCallStateHooks();
  const { camera, isMute } = useCameraState();
  return (
    <button onClick={() => camera.toggle()}>
      {isMute ? 'Turn on camera' : 'Turn off camera'}
    </button>
  );
};

export const MyMicrophoneButton = () => {
  const { useMicrophoneState } = useCallStateHooks();
  const { microphone, isMute } = useMicrophoneState();
  return (
    <button onClick={() => microphone.toggle()}>
      {isMute ? 'Turn on microphone' : 'Turn off microphone'}
    </button>
  );
};
```

More information about this topic can be found in the [Camera & Microphone guide](../../guides/camera-and-microphone).

## UI Components

The goal of this library is to make it easy to build any type of video/calling experience. You have a few options for the UI:

- Build your own UI components using the state as shown above.
- Use our library of built-in components.
- Mix & Match between your own and built-in components.

The built-in components you can customize using [theming](../../ui-components/video-theme) and props. If you decide to build your own components we have a [UI Cookbook section](../../ui-cookbook/overview) to help you get started.

Let's see an example where we set up the UI using built-in components:

- Set up theming using the `StreamTheme` provider
- Choose a [UI layout](../../ui-components/core/call-layout) from the SDK-provided ones, such as `<SpeakerLayout>`, which provides a layout suitable for speaker-focused video calls.
- Additionally, hook in the default `<CallControls />` component to enable call control functionalities (such as mute, hang up, etc.).

```tsx
import {
  CallControls,
  SpeakerLayout,
  StreamCall,
  StreamTheme,
  StreamVideo,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

import '@stream-io/video-react-sdk/dist/css/styles.css';

export const MyApp = () => {
  // Assuming you have the 'client' and 'call' created
  return (
    <StreamVideo client={client}>
      <StreamCall call={call}>
        <StreamTheme>
          <SpeakerLayout />
          <CallControls />
        </StreamTheme>
      </StreamCall>
    </StreamVideo>
  );
};
```
