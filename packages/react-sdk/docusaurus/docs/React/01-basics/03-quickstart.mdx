The Stream Video React SDK is a highly customizable software development kit
that enables audio and video calling features for new and existing applications.

It consists of the Low-Level Client (LLC), a set of core components that form the foundation of the SDK,
and numerous UI components that integrators can utilize as-is or with minor customization options.

This chapter provides a guide on how to add the Stream Video React SDK to a new or existing project,
establish a connection to the Stream platform and build a simple video calling interface with the built-in UI components.

## Install and Connect

To get started with the Stream Video React SDK, a few steps are required. These steps include:

Install the SDK using your package manager of choice, such as `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`.

```bash
# example with yarn
yarn install @stream-io/video-react-sdk
```

Collect the necessary configuration parameters, as:

- `apiKey`: The API key for your application, which you can find in the [Stream Dashboard](https://dashboard.getstream.io/dashboard).
- `user_id`: The unique identifier for the user connecting to the Stream platform.
- `token`: The authentication token for the user connecting to the Stream platform. You can generate this token using the following [Stream Token Tool](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/react/tokens_and_authentication/?language=javascript#manually-generating-tokens)

These parameters are essential for authentication and authorization to access the Stream platform.

```ts
const apiKey = 'your-api-key';
const userId = 'user-id';
const token = 'authentication-token';
```

:::note
You can more about user authentication and authorization
in the [Authenticating Your Users](../../guides/01-authentication) chapter.
:::

Create an instance of [`StreamVideoClient`](../../call-engine/StreamVideoClient/) by utilizing the [`useCreateStreamVideoClient`](../../call-engine/hooks-and-contexts#usecreatestreamvideoclient) hook provided by the SDK.

This hook initializes the client with the provided configuration parameters,
and establishes a connection to the Stream platform.

```ts
import { useCreateStreamVideoClient, User } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

const apiKey = 'your-api-key';
const userId = 'user-id';
const token = 'authentication-token';

export const MyApp = () => {
  const user: User = { id: userId };
  const client = useCreateStreamVideoClient({
    apiKey,
    user,
    tokenOrProvider: token,
  });

  // Further logic and rendering
};
```

## Bridge it together

Now, as you have a working instance of the `StreamVideoClient`,
you can integrate it into your application and start using the SDK's features and functionalities.

:::tip
In this example, we are going to use the fundamental (core) components provided by the SDK to build a simple video calling interface.

You can read a brief overview of them in the [Core Components](./04-core-components.mdx) chapter.
:::

Within your application, add the `<StreamVideo client={client} />` provider component.
This component makes the `StreamVideoClient` instance available to all child components via the React Context API.
Many of the SDK's components rely on this context to function correctly.

```tsx
import { StreamVideo } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

export const MyApp = () => {
  // Assuming you have the 'client' instance created
  return (
    // highlight-start
    <StreamVideo client={client}>
      {/* Your application's components and UI */}
    </StreamVideo>
    // highlight-end
  );
};
```

[Enable the default theme](../../ui-components/video-theme/) by importing the `@stream-io/video-react-sdk/dist/css/styles.css` stylesheet
and wrap your UI code with the `<StreamTheme />` component.
This ensures a consistent and visually appealing look for your video calling interface.

```tsx
import '@stream-io/video-react-sdk/dist/css/styles.css';
import { StreamTheme, StreamVideo } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

export const MyApp = () => {
  // Assuming you have the 'client' instance created
  return (
    <StreamVideo client={client}>
      // highlight-next-line
      <StreamTheme>{/* Your application's components and UI */}</StreamTheme>
    </StreamVideo>
  );
};
```

Choose a UI layout from the SDK-provided ones, such as `<SpeakerLayout>`, which provides a layout suitable for speaker-focused video calls.
Additionally, hook in the default `<CallControls />` component to enable call control functionalities (such as mute, hang up, etc.).

```tsx
import '@stream-io/video-react-sdk/dist/css/styles.css';
import {
  CallControls,
  SpeakerLayout,
  StreamVideo,
  StreamTheme,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

export const MyApp = () => {
  // Assuming you have the 'client' instance created
  return (
    <StreamVideo client={client}>
      <StreamTheme>
        // highlight-start
        <SpeakerLayout />
        <CallControls />
        // highlight-end
      </StreamTheme>
    </StreamVideo>
  );
};
```

Wrap your chosen UI layout with the `<StreamCall>` component, wich would take care of call creation and joining.

```tsx
import '@stream-io/video-react-sdk/dist/css/styles.css';
import {
  CallControls,
  StreamCall,
  StreamTheme,
  StreamVideo,
  SpeakerLayout,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

const MyApp = () => {
  // Assuming you have the 'client' instance created
  return (
    <StreamVideo client={client}>
      <StreamTheme>
        // highlight-start
        <StreamCall
          callType="default"
          callId="my-first-call"
          data={{ create: true }}
          autoJoin
        >
          <SpeakerLayout />
          <CallControls />
        </StreamCall>
        // highlight-end
      </StreamTheme>
    </StreamVideo>
  );
};
```
