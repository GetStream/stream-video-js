This page describes the main building blocks of the SDK.

## Call Engine

We understand the term **call engine** as a set of the following functionalities:

- The client lets you interact with Stream's video API
- Various utility hooks and contexts that let you access the state easily and give high-level APIs for common video/audio call-related tasks such as device management

The SDK API supports two different call lifecycles. We have prepared a [Call lifecycle guide](../02-guides/02-call-lifecycle.gen.mdx) to help you identify the right scenario for your project.

Additionally, there are various available call types configurations suiting different use cases (for example, livestream or audio room). If you want to know more about these, visit our [Configuring call defaults](./06-configuring-call-defaults.mdx) guide.

Throughout our "Guides" section, you'll be able to learn the most important high-level concepts of the Call Engine.

## UI components

Our SDK comes with powerful built-in components that make building a video/audio call application easy. Still, it has various customization options that enable you to create a unique product. For more information, visit the [UI Customization guide](./07-ui-customization-options.mdx).
