This page describes the main building blocks of the SDK.

## Call Engine

We understand the term **call engine** as a set of the following functionalities:

- The client lets you interact with Stream's video API
- Various utility hooks and contexts that let you access the state easily and give high-level APIs for common video/audio call-related tasks such as device management

Stream's video API supports two different call lifecycles. Our [Call lifecycle](../02-guides/02-call-lifecycle.gen.mdx) guide provides more information on the topic to help you decide which suits your requirements.

Additionally, there are various available call types with configurations suiting different use cases (for example, livestream or audio room). If you want to know more about these, visit our [Configuring call defaults](./06-configuring-call-defaults.mdx) guide.

Throughout our "Guides" section, you'll be able to learn the most important high-level concepts of the Call Engine.

## UI components

Our SDK comes with powerful built-in components that make building a video/audio call application easy. Still, it has various customization options that enable you to create a unique product. For more information, visit the [UI Customization guide](./07-ui-customization-options.mdx).
