## Introduction

The Stream Video React SDK enables you to easily build any type of Video and Audio call experiences in your React apps.

The SDK allows you to build all sorts of applications that use audio and video capabilities:

- Meeting Applications: similar to popular tools, such as Zoom.
- Audio Rooms: build experiences close to Twitter Spaces or Clubhouse
- Call functionality: known from your favorite messengers that allow you to call and meet with your friends and loved ones.

These are not the only possibilities as we've built our SDK to be extremely flexible and enable you to build out the applications that you want.

## SDK architecture

### Call Engine

The **call engine** consists of the following functionalities:

- The client lets you interact with Stream's video API
- Various utility hooks and contexts that let you access the state easily and give high-level APIs for common video/audio call-related tasks such as device management

Throughout our "Guides" section, you'll be able to learn the most important high-level concepts of the Call Engine.

### UI components

Our SDK comes with powerful built-in components that make building a video/audio call application easy. Still, it has various customization options that enable you to create a unique product.
