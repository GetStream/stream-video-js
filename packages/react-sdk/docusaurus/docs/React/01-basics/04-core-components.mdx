## Introduction

This chapter provides an overview of the core components that Stream Video React SDK provides.
These components play an important role in the SDK as they are the main building blocks, and integrators can use them to build their custom UIs.

:::note
In the rest of the documentation chapters, you will see many examples that use these core components.
It is crucial to understand how they work and what they do.
:::

## StreamVideo

The `<StreamVideo/>` component is the root component of the SDK.
It serves as a context provider that allows child components to utilize the
[`useStreamVideoClient`](../../call-engine/hooks-and-contexts#usestreamvideoclient) hook and access the [`StreamVideoClient`](../../call-engine/StreamVideoClient) public API.
It also initializes an [i18n instance for localization purposes](../../advanced/i18n).

```tsx
import {
  StreamVideo,
  useCreateStreamVideoClient,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

export const App = () => {
  const client = useCreateStreamVideoClient(/* ... */);
  return (
    // highlight-next-line
    <StreamVideo client={client}>
      <MyUI />
    </StreamVideo>
  );
};
```

## StreamCall

The `<StreamCall />` component is a declarative component wrapper around [`Call`](../../call-engine/Call) objects.

It can be initialized with either `callType` and `callId` or a `call` instance.
When `callType` and `callId` are provided, a new call will be created on the backend. The contents of the `data` prop will be sent to the backend.

It has two additional props:

- `autoJoin` to immediately join the provided or newly created call (defaults to `false`), and
- `autoLoad` to optionally create and load the call's metadata from the backend (defaults to `true`). This prop also creates a subscription to the event bus on the backend to receive events for the given call.

```tsx
import {
  StreamCall,
  StreamVideo,
  useCreateStreamVideoClient,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

export const App = () => {
  const client = useCreateStreamVideoClient(/* ... */);
  return (
    <StreamVideo client={client}>
      // highlight-next-line
      <StreamCall callType="default" callId="my-call-id">
        <MyUI />
      </StreamCall>
    </StreamVideo>
  );
};
```

Additionally, the `<StreamCall />` component sets up a [`MediaDevicesProvider`](../../guides/camera-and-microphone) instance, making device management (microphone, camera) easier for integrators.

## ParticipantView

The `<ParticipantView/>` component is a core component that renders a participant's video and plays the participant's audio.

It handles the participant's visibility state in a defined viewport,
subscribes to the most appropriate video track quality and resolution (dynascale), and
can toggle between video and avatar based on the participant's video state.

It requires a `participant` prop to be provided. This prop should be an instance of [`StreamVideoParticipant`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/blob/main/packages/client/src/types.ts)

:::note
It is recommended to use this component as provided, as custom implementation would require re-implementing many of the SDK's internal features.

However, the UI it renders is fully customizable. Keep reading further to learn how.
:::

The `<ParticipantView/>` component accepts the following props (all optional) that can be used to customize its visual appearance:

- `ParticipantViewUI`: A React component or an element for UI customization (default: `DefaultParticipantViewUI`)
- `VideoPlaceholder`: A React component or an element used as a placeholder for video (default: `DefaultVideoPlaceholder`)

```tsx
import {
  ParticipantView,
  StreamCall,
  StreamVideo,
  useCreateStreamVideoClient,
  useParticipants,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

export const App = () => {
  const client = useCreateStreamVideoClient(/* ... */);
  return (
    <StreamVideo client={client}>
      <StreamCall callType="default" callId="my-call-id">
        // highlight-next-line
        <MyCustomLayout />
      </StreamCall>
    </StreamVideo>
  );
};

export const MyCustomLayout = () => {
  const participants = useParticipants();
  return (
    <div className="my-custom-layout">
      {participants.map((participant) => (
        // highlight-next-line
        <ParticipantView
          participant={participant}
          key={participant.sessionId}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

:::note
You can further customize the visual look of the `<ParticipantView/>` component. To learn how, see the following guide: [ParticipantView Customization](../../ui-cookbook/participant-view-customizations/).

## Default Call Layouts

The Stream Video React SDK provides several default call layouts that apps can use out of the box.

### SpeakerLayout

The `<SpeakerLayout>` component is a layout that puts the dominant speaker in focus (center stage) while rendering other participants in a scrollable bar.

```tsx
import {
  SpeakerLayout,
  StreamCall,
  StreamVideo,
  useCreateStreamVideoClient,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

export const App = () => {
  const client = useCreateStreamVideoClient(/* ... */);
  return (
    <StreamVideo client={client}>
      <StreamCall callType="default" callId="my-call-id">
        // highlight-next-line
        <SpeakerLayout />
      </StreamCall>
    </StreamVideo>
  );
};
```

### PaginatedGridLayout

The `<PaginatedGridLayout>` component is a layout that renders participants in a grid, with a default size of 4x4.
The grid can paginate left and right to accommodate more participants. Active participants (speakers) are positioned on the first page by default.

```tsx
import {
  PaginatedGridLayout,
  StreamCall,
  StreamVideo,
  useCreateStreamVideoClient,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

export const App = () => {
  const client = useCreateStreamVideoClient(/* ... */);
  return (
    <StreamVideo client={client}>
      <StreamCall callType="default" callId="my-call-id">
        // highlight-next-line
        <PaginatedGridLayout />
      </StreamCall>
    </StreamVideo>
  );
};
```

:::tip
These layouts are provided as a convenience for integrators to quickly get started with the SDK.
They do offer some customization options that can be found in the following guide: [ParticipantView Customization](../../ui-cookbook/participant-view-customizations/).
:::

:::tip
The default sorting of the participants can be customized as well. See the following guide for more information: [Participant Sorting](../../guides/sorting-api/).
