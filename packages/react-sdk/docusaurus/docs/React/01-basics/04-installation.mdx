The installation of the packages for the Stream Video React SDK can be either done with `yarn` or `npm`.

### Install the React SDK

For `yarn`:

```
yarn add @stream-io/video-react-sdk
```

For `npm`:

```
npm install @stream-io/video-react-sdk
```

### Install the low-level client

For `yarn`:

```
yarn add @stream-io/video-client
```

For `npm`:

```
npm install @stream-io/video-client
```

While this installs the video client, it might be a good idea for you to also install the `react-bindings` package that we offer:

```
yarn add @stream-io/video-react-bindings
```

or

```
npm install @stream-io/video-react-bindings
```

:::note
The `react-bindings` comes implicitly packaged within the `video-react-sdk` but not if you're building on top of our client.
