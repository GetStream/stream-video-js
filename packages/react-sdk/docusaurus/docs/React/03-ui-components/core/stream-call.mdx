The `<StreamCall />` component is a declarative component wrapper around `Call` objects. It utilizes the `StreamCallProvider` to make the [call and its state](../../../guides/call-and-participant-state) available to all child components.

## General usage

```tsx
import { StreamCall } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

export const App = () => {
  const call = /* ... */;

  return (
    // highlight-next-line
    <StreamCall call={call}>
      <MyUI />
    </StreamCall>
  );
};
```

## Props
