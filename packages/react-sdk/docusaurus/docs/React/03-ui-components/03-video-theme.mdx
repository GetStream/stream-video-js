## Introduction

React Video SDK ships with a default UI theme (CSS stylesheet) that you can include in your application.
In this chapter, we'll go through the details on how you can utilize the default theme.

## Usage

### Importing the CSS

The SDK includes a CSS stylesheet that can be easily imported into your project to apply a pre-built theme to your video components.
To use the CSS stylesheet, you can import it from the SDK's dist folder:

```tsx
import '@stream-io/video-react-sdk/dist/css/style.css';
// ideally, Stream Video theme should be imported before your own styles
import './my-styles.css';
```

### Using the StreamTheme component

The `<StreamTheme />` component is a utility component that renders an HTML element with the CSS class name of `str-video` attached to it.
This CSS class enables our default theme to be applied to the children of the rendered element.

The `<StreamTheme />` supports the `as` property, allowing you to render different HTML elements or custom components based on the value of the `as` prop.
By default, the `<StreamTheme />` component renders a `<div>` element, but you can pass any valid HTML element or custom React component to the `as` prop to render a different element.

In addition, you can also pass any other HTML attribute as a prop to the StreamTheme component, which will be applied to the rendered element.

```tsx
import { StreamTheme, StreamVideo } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <StreamVideo client={client}>
      <StreamTheme as="main" className="my-custom-root-class">
        <MyAppUI />
      </StreamTheme>
    </StreamVideo>
  );
};
```
