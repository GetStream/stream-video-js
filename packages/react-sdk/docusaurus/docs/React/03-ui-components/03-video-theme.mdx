## Introduction

The React Video SDK ships with a default UI theme (CSS stylesheet) that you can include in your application.
In this chapter, we'll go through the details on how you can utilize and customize the default theme.

## Usage

### Importing the CSS

The SDK includes a CSS stylesheet that can be easily imported into your project to apply a pre-built theme to your video components.
To use the CSS stylesheet, you can import it from the SDK's dist folder:

```tsx
import '@stream-io/video-react-sdk/dist/css/style.css';
// ideally, Stream Video theme should be imported before your own styles
import './my-styles.css';
```

### Using the StreamTheme component

The `<StreamTheme />` component is a utility component that renders an HTML element with the CSS class name of `str-video` attached to it.
This CSS class enables our default theme to be applied to the children of the rendered element.

The `<StreamTheme />` supports the `as` property, allowing you to render different HTML elements or custom components based on the value of the `as` prop.
By default, the `<StreamTheme />` component renders a `<div>` element, but you can pass any valid HTML element or custom React component to the `as` prop to render a different element.

In addition, you can also pass any other HTML attribute as a prop to the `StreamTheme` component, which will be applied to the rendered element.

```tsx
import { StreamTheme, StreamVideo } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <StreamVideo client={client}>
      <StreamTheme as="main" className="my-custom-root-class">
        <MyAppUI />
      </StreamTheme>
    </StreamVideo>
  );
};
```

## Customization

### Theme variables

You can customize the **colors**, **border-radius settings**, and **icons** used by the built-in UI components.

Customizing can be done using **CSS variables** defined in our [variables file](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/blob/main/packages/styling/src/_variables.scss).

```scss
import '@stream-io/video-react-sdk/dist/css/style.css';

// Use your own font
html {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

.str-video {
  --str-video__primary-color: #6002EE;
  --str-video__secondary-color: #90ee02;
  --str-video__text-color1: #282b2b;
  --str-video__border-radius-circle: 15px;
  --str-video__icon--download: url('base64 encoded SVG')
}
```

### Custom CSS code

If you want to tweak the design/layout of a built-in component, it's often easier to write a few lines of CSS code than to create your own custom component.

However, please note that the HTML/CSS structure of the UI components can change with any new release (even with patch releases), so you should test if your custom CSS codes are still working with each SDK update.

[CSS cascade layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_layers) make it easier to override the default styles of the SDK, here is an example:

```css
@import url('@stream-io/video-react-sdk/dist/css/styles.css') layer(video-default);

.str-video__call-controls__button {
  padding: 20px;
}
```
