import RecordingInProgressNotification from '../../assets/03-ui-components/recording-in-progress-notification.png';

The `RecordingInProgressNotification` component is based on `Notification` component that is a simple popover. The SDK attaches the component to [`RecordCallButton`](../../call/call-controls). The popover rendering is controlled by detecting if there is a recording in progress, `useToggleCallRecording()`.

<div
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    display: 'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    marginBlock: '1rem',
  }}
>
  <img
    src={RecordingInProgressNotification}
    alt="Default UI of RecordingInProgressNotification component"
    width={300}
  />
</div>

## General usage

The component is used by wrapping the component to which it will refer:

```tsx
<RecordingInProgressNotification>
  <RecordCallButton />
</RecordingInProgressNotification>
```

## Props

| Name   | Type                    | Default                      |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `text` | `string` \| `undefined` | `'Recording in progress...'` |

Text message displayed by the notification.
