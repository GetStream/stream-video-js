import CallStats from '../../assets/03-ui-components/call-stats.png';

The SDK's default component to display statistics about a call is called `CallStats`. It displays:

- **Call Latency** graph that outlines average round trip time (in ms).
- **Call Performance** section that displays the below listed call statistics

<img src={CallStats} alt="Panel displaying call statistics" width={300}/>

### The call statistics displayed:

- **Region** - the SFU we are connected to
- **Latency** - the time it takes to deliver the data between the SFU and the app
- **Receive jitter** - the variation in the delay of receiving packets of data over a network
- **Publish jitter** - the variation in the delay of sending packets of data over a network
- **Publish resolution** - video resolution we are publishing
- **Publish quality drop reason** - optional explanation of the reason, why the video image quality we are sending has diminished
- **Receiving resolution** - video resolution we are receiving
- **Receive quality drop reason** - optional explanation of the reason, why the video image quality we are receiving has diminished
- **Publish bitrate** - the rate at which data is transmitted from the app to the SFU
- **Receiving bitrate** - the rate at which data is transmitted from the SFU to the app

## General usage
The default component is just rendered without passing any props:

```tsx
const YourComponent = (someProps: SomeProps) => {
    // omitted code ...

    return (
      {/* omitted code ... */}
        <CallStats />
      {/* omitted code ... */}
    );
}
```
