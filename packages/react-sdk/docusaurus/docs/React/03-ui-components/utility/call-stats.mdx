import CallStats from '../../assets/03-ui-components/call-stats.png';

The SDK's default component to display statistics about a call is called `CallStats`. It displays:

- **Call Latency** graph that outlines average round trip time (in ms).
- **Call Performance** section that displays the below listed call statistics

<img src={CallStats} alt="Panel displaying call statistics" width={300} />

### The call statistics displayed:

- **Region** - the server we are connected to
- **Latency** - the time it takes to deliver the data between the server and the app
- **Receive jitter** - the variation in the delay of receiving packets of data over a network
- **Publish jitter** - the variation in the delay of sending packets of data over a network
- **Publish resolution** - video resolution we are publishing
- **Publish quality drop reason** - optional explanation of the reason, why the video image quality we are sending has diminished
- **Receiving resolution** - video resolution we are receiving
- **Receive quality drop reason** - optional explanation of the reason, why the video image quality we are receiving has diminished
- **Publish bitrate** - the rate at which data is transmitted from the app to the server
- **Receiving bitrate** - the rate at which data is transmitted from the server to the app

## General usage

The default component is just rendered without passing any props:

```tsx
const MyCallStats = () => {
  // omitted code ...

  return (
    /* omitted code ... */
    <CallStats />
    /* omitted code ... */
  );
};
```

## Props

None

## Customization

You can create your own call statistics component using the SDK's [call state hooks](../../../guides/call-and-participant-state/#call-state).
