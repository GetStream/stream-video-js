import SpeakingWhileMutedNotification from '../../assets/03-ui-components/speaking-while-muted-notification.png';

The `SpeakingWhileMuted` component is based on `Notification` component that is a simple popover. The SDK attaches the component to [`ToggleAudioPublishingButton`](../../call/call-controls). The popover rendering is controlled by sound detection mechanism put in place by `createSoundDetector()` function.

<div
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    display: 'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    marginBlock: '1rem',
  }}
>
  <img
    src={SpeakingWhileMutedNotification}
    alt="Default UI of SpeakingWhileMutedNotification component"
    width={300}
  />
</div>

## General usage

The component is used by wrapping the component to which it will refer:

```tsx
<SpeakingWhileMutedNotification>
  <ToggleAudioPublishingButton />
</SpeakingWhileMutedNotification>
```
