## Client & Auth

Before joining a call, it is necessary to set up the video client. Here's a basic example:

```ts

// TODO: this is not the current constructor for StreamVideoClient
// TODO: token param is nicer than tokenOrTokenProvider
// TODO: logging is missing

import {StreamVideoClient} from "@stream-io/video-client";

const client = new StreamVideoClient({
    apiKey: apiKey,
    token: token,
    user,
});
```

- The API Key can be found in your dashboard.
- The user can be either authenticated, anonymous or guest.
- Note: You can store custom data on the user object, if required.

Typically, you'll want to initialize the client when your application loads and use a context provider to make it available to the rest of your application.

## Generating a token

- Tokens need to be generated server side. You can use our server side SDKs to quickly add support for this. Typically you integrate this into the part of your codebase where you login or register users. The tokens provide a way to authenticate a user or give access to a specific set of calls.
- Here's a valid user and token to help you get started on the client side, before integrating with your backend API.

## Different types of users

- Authenticated users are users that have an account on your app.
- Guest users are temporary user accounts. You can use it to temporarily give someone a name and image when joining a call.
- Anonymous users are users that are not authenticated. It's common to use this for watching a livestream or similar where you aren't authenticated.

This example shows the client setup for a guest user:

```ts
// TODO: for this we need {id, type="guest"}
```

And here's an example for an anonymous user
```ts
// TODO: for this we need {id, type="anonymous"}
```

## Client options

Here's a more complete example of the client options:

```ts
```

The full list of supported options is:

// TODO: for this we need to have these options available

- token
- tokenProvider
- loggingLevel
- audioFilters
- videoFilters

## StreamVideo context provider

You can use the `StreamVideo` context provider to make the SDK client available to the rest of the application. We also use the `tokenProvider` to show how to perform auth server-side.

```tsx
import { useMemo, useCallback } from 'react';
import {StreamVideoClient} from "@stream-io/video-client";
import {
  StreamVideo,
  User,
} from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

export const App = () => {
  const user = useMemo<User>(
    () => ({
      id, name,
    }),
    [],
  );

  const tokenProvider = useCallback(async () => {
    // here is the code fetching a token from your own backend
  }, [user]);

  const client = new StreamVideoClient({
    apiKey: apiKey,
    tokenProvider: tokenProvider,
    user,
  });

  return (
    <StreamVideo client={client}>
      <MyVideoApp />
    </StreamVideo>
  );
};
```
