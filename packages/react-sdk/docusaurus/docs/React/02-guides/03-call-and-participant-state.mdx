title: Call & Participant State
description: How the state is exposed
---

You can access call, participant and client state using hooks. These hooks are reactive (their value is updated on WebSocket events and API calls).

## Call state

To observe call state you need to provide a `Call` instance to the [`StreamCall` component](../../ui-components/core/stream-call).

Let's see an example where we use the `useCall` and `useCallCallingState` hooks to display some basic information about the call:

```tsx
export default function App() {
  let call: Call;

  return (
    <StreamCall call={call}>
      <CallUI />
    </StreamCall>
  );
}

const CallUI = () => {
  const call = useCall();
  const callingState = useCallCallingState();

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Call: {call?.data?.cid}</div>
      <div>State: {callingState}</div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

This approach makes it possible to access the call state and be notified about changes anywhere in your application without having to manually subscribe to WebSocket events.

The `StreamCall` component uses the `StreamCallProvider` under the hood.

Here are all the call-related state hooks:

| Name                              | Description                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `useCall`                         | The `Call` instance that is registered with `StreamCall`. You need the `Call` instance to initiate API calls. |
| `useCallCallingState`             | Provides information about the call state. For example, `RINGING`, `JOINED` or `RECONNECTING`.                |
| `useCallMembers`                  | The list of call members                                                                                      |
| `useCallMetadata`                 | The `CallResponse`, see below for more information.                                                           |

| `useCallStatsReport`              | When stats gathering is enabled, this observable will emit a new value at a regular (configurable) interval.  |
| `useDominantSpeaker`              | The participant that is the current dominant speaker of the call.                                             |
| `useHasOngoingScreenShare`        | It will return `true` if at least one participant is sharing their screen.                                    |
| `useHasPermissions`               | Returns `true` if the local participant has all the given permissions.                                        |
| `useIsCallRecordingInProgress`    | It's' `true` if the call is being recorded.                                                                   |
| `useIsCallBroadcastingInProgress` | It's `true` if the call is being broadcasted.                                                                 |
| `useIsCallLive`                   | It's `true` if the call is currently live.                                                                    |

## Participant state

If you want to display information about the joined participants of the call you can use these hooks:

| `useParticipantCount`          | The approximate participant count of the active call. This includes the [anonymous users](../client-auth/#anonymous-users) as well, it is computed on the server-side. |
| `useAnonymousParticipantCount` | The approximate participant count of anonymous users in the active call.                                                                                               |

```tsx
export default function App() {
  let call: call;

  return (
    <StreamCall call={call}>
      <CallUI />
    </StreamCall>
  );
}

const CallUI = () => {
  const participantCount = useParticipantCount();
  const localParticipant = useLocalParticipant();

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Number of participants: {participantCount}</div>
      <div>Session ID: {localParticipant.sessionId}</div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

The `StreamVideoParticipant` object contains the following information:

| Name                      | Description                                                                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `audioLevel`              | The audio level of the participant.                                                         |

| `sessionId`               | Participant's session ID.                                                                   |
| `userId`                  | Participant's user ID.                                                                      |
| `videoStream`             | The published video `MediaStream`.                                                          |
| `videoDimension`          | The preferred video dimensions for this participant.                                        |
| `viewportVisibilityState` | The visibility state of the participant's video element within the pre-configured viewport. |

The `StreamVideoLocalParticipant` has these additional properties:

| Name                  | Description                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| `videoDeviceId`       | The device ID of the currently selected video input device.  |
| `audioOutputDeviceId` | The device ID of the currently selected audio output device. |

## Client state

To observe client state you need to provide a `StreamVideoClient` instance to the `StreamVideo` context provider:

Let's see an example:

If you want to observe the connected user you can use the `useConnectedUser` hook.

```tsx
export default function App() {
  let client: StreamVideoClient;

  return (
    <StreamVideo client={client}>
      <Header></Header>
    </StreamVideo>
  );
}

const Header = () => {
  const user = useConnectedUser();
  return <div>{user ? `Logged in: ${user.name}` : 'Logged out'}</div>;
};
```

This approach makes it possible to access the client state and be notified about changes anywhere in your application without having to manually subscribe to WebSocket events.

Here are the list of client-state hooks:

| Name                   | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useStreamVideoClient` | The `StreamVideoClient` instance.                                                                                                           |
| `useConnectedUser`     | Returns the connected user.                                                                                                                 |
| `useCalls`             | A list of all notifications about created calls. These calls can be outgoing (I have called somebody) or incoming (somebody has called me). |

The `UserResponse` contains the following properties:

| Name         | Description                                           |
