import SDKSpecific from '../SDKSpecific';

In many types of calls, there is a requirement for providing different users with certain permissions and capabilities.
A typical example is a webinar where the host wants to control who can speak or who can share their video or screen.

The Stream Video SDK provides a certain set of permissions and capabilities
that can be used to control the behavior of participants in a call.

## Conceptual overview

### Roles

The Stream Video API allows assigning roles to users. Each user has a global role, and they will also have a call-level role for each call they join. The Stream Video API provides a set of predefined roles, but it's also possible to create your own roles.

### Call types

[Call types](../../guides/10-configuring-call-types/) also allow for a more granular control system:

- you can enable/disable certain features on a call type level
- you can configure how each call-level role works on a call type level

### Capabilities

Based on a user's roles and the call type settings, we can determine which actions are allowed for a user joined to a specific call.

## Permissions

As soon as you join a call, the `Call` instance would allow you to check the permissions of the local user
or perform some permission-related actions:

### Check permissions

```ts
import { OwnCapability } from '@stream-io/video-client';

const call = streamVideoClient.call(type, id);
const canSendAudio = call.permissionsContext.hasPermission(
  OwnCapability.SEND_AUDIO,
);
```

<SDKSpecific name="react">

In our React Video SDK, you can use the `useHasPermissions` hook to check for permissions.

```tsx
const canSendAudio = useHasPermissions(OwnCapability.SEND_AUDIO);
```

</SDKSpecific>

### Request permissions

Every user may request permission to perform certain actions depending on the call type and call settings.
For example, in an audio-room call type, only the hosts have `send-audio` permission by default.
Other users should request this permission before they can start sending audio if the call settings allow it.

```ts
import { OwnCapability } from '@stream-io/video-client';

const call = streamVideoClient.call(type, id);
if (!call.permissionsContext.canRequest(OwnCapability.SEND_AUDIO)) {
  console.log('The host has disabled the ability to request this permission');
  return;
}
await call.requestPermissions({
  permissions: [OwnCapability.SEND_AUDIO],
});
```

### Approving permission requests

Call hosts and moderators can approve permission requests from other users.
Whenever a user requests a certain permission, a `call.permission_request` event will be emitted on the `Call` instance.
You can listen to this event and approve the request.

```ts
import {
  PermissionRequestEvent,
  StreamCallEvent,
} from '@stream-io/video-client';

const call = streamVideoClient.call(type, id);
call.on('call.permission_request', async (event: StreamCallEvent) => {
  const request = event as PermissionRequestEvent;
  if (shouldApproveRequest(request)) {
    await call.grantPermissions(request.user.id, request.permissions);
  }
});
```

### Moderation

At any time, a moderator or host can decide to either grant or revoke certain permission to any participant.

```ts
import { OwnCapability } from '@stream-io/video-client';

const call = streamVideoClient.call(type, id);
await call.updateUserPermissions({
  user_id: 'demo-user',
  grant_permission: [OwnCapability.SEND_AUDIO, OwnCapability.SEND_VIDEO],
  revoke_permissions: [OwnCapability.SCREENSHARE],
});

// alternate API for granting user permissions:
await call.grantPermissions('demo-user', [
  OwnCapability.SEND_AUDIO,
  OwnCapability.SEND_VIDEO,
]);

// alternate API for revoking user permissions:
await call.revokePermissions('demo-user', [OwnCapability.SCREENSHARE]);
```

The end user would get notified via a WebSocket event with a type: `call.permissions_updated`.
In the case of revoked permissions, the SDK would automatically stop publishing the appropriate tracks.

### Muting participants

In addition to granting or revoking permissions, a moderator or host can also mute a participant.
This is a common scenario as quite often, participants may be a source of unwanted noise or distraction.

```ts
const call = streamVideoClient.call(type, id);
await call.muteUser('demo-user-id', 'audio');
await call.muteUser('demo-user-id', 'video');
await call.muteUser('demo-user-id', 'screenshare');

// or, mute in bulk
await call.muteUser(['demo-user-id', 'demo-user-id-2'], 'audio');

// or, muting self
await call.muteSelf('audio');

// or, muting others
await call.muteOthers('audio');

// or, mute all, including self.
await call.muteAllUsers('audio');
```

This operation doesn't revoke any permission, and the user would still be able to un-mute itself.

### Ending call for everyone

In some cases, a moderator or host may want to end the call for everyone.

```ts
const call = streamVideoClient.call(type, id);
await call.endCall();
```

This operation will emit `call.ended` event to every participant in the call.
The SDK would automatically stop publishing any tracks and leave the call.

Ended calls can't be re-joined.

## Capabilities

Every user connecting to a Stream Call has a set of Capabilities.
The capabilities of the local user live in the metadata of the `Call` instance.

```tsx
const call = streamVideoClient.call(type, id);
const { own_capabilities } = call.state.metadata;
```

<SDKSpecific name="react">

In our React Video SDK, you can use the `useOwnCapabilities` hook.

```tsx
const ownCapabilities = useOwnCapabilities();
```

</SDKSpecific>

Capabilities will have the type [`OwnCapability`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-js/blob/main/packages/client/src/gen/coordinator/index.ts).
