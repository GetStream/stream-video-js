Reactions allow call participants to send emojis in real-time.

Custom events let participants send and receive arbitrary WebSocket messages. For example, if you want to implement a drawing feature in your call, you can use custom events for synchronizing the drawing board between participants.

## Reactions

:::tip

The [`ReactionsButton`](../../ui-components/call/call-controls/#reactionsbutton) and [`Reaction`](../../ui-components/utility/reaction/) components support reactions out-of-the-box, but for advanced use-cases you can also build your own reaction system.

:::

### Sending reactions

You can send a reaction using the `sendReaction` method of a `Call` instance.

```typescript
const call: Call;

await call.sendReaction({ type: 'raised-hand' });
```

The value of the `type` attribute can be any string.

It's also possible to provide additional data for the reaction:

```typescript
const call: Call;

await call.sendReaction({
  type: 'raised-hand',
  emoji_code: ':raise-hand:',
  custom: { clearAfterTimeout: true },
});
```

The `emoji_code` attribute is used by the SDK components to decide which emoji to display on the UI.

The `custom` property can contain any data.

### Receiving reactions

Reactions are only delivered to clients that are [watching the call](../../advanced/events/#call-events).

The [participant state](../../guides/call-and-participant-state/#observe-participant-state) will contain the latest reaction of each participant:

```typescript
const { useParticipants } = useCallStateHooks();
const participants = useParticipants();

const reactions = participants.map((p) => p.reaction);
```

You can also subscribe to the `call.reaction_new` WebSocket event to receive reactions. For more information, check out our [Events guide](../../advanced/events).

### Clearing reactions

If you're using the [participant state](../../guides/call-and-participant-state/#observe-participant-state) for receiving reactions, you can also clear the latest reaction using the `resetReaction` method:

```typescript
const call: Call;
const { useParticipants } = useCallStateHooks();
const participants = useParticipants();

call.resetReaction(participants[0].sessionId);
```

This is a local action, it won't send any WebSocket messages. It's helpful if you only want to display reactions for a set period of time.
