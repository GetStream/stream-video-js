description: An overview of how to create calls and join them
---

This guide shows how to create, join, leave, and end calls and ring calls.

## Call

`Call` represents the main building block of our SDK. This object abstracts away the user actions, join flows and exposes the call state.

### Create call

You can create a call by specifying its `callType` and `callId`:

The [Call Type](../../guides/configuring-call-types) controls which features are enabled, and sets up permissions.
You can reuse the same call multiple times. As an example, if you're building a telemedicine app calls will be connected to an appointment.
Using your own appointment id as the call id makes it easy to find the call later.

```typescript
const callType = 'default';
const callId = 'test-call';

const call = client.call(callType, callId);
await call.getOrCreate();

// or create it with options:
await call.getOrCreate({
  data: {
    /* call creation options */
  },
});
```

See all possible options at the [Call creation options section](#call-creation-options).

### Join call

```typescript
const callType = 'default';
const callId = 'test-call';

const call = client.call(callType, callId);
await call.join();
```

### Create and join a call

For convenience, you can create and join a call in a single operation. One of the flags you can provide there is `create`.
Set this to `true` if you want to enable creating new call. Set it to `false` if you only want to join an existing call.

See all possible options at the [Call creation options section](#call-creation-options).

```typescript
await call.join({
  create: true,
  data: {
    /* call creation options */
  },
});
```

### Join with mic and camera on or off

You can override the default mic and camera settings before you join a call.
Typically, you should configure this in your Lobby view:

```typescript
const call = client.call('default', 'test-call');

// enable mic and camera
await call.camera.enable();
await call.microphone.enable();

// alternatively, you can disable them
await call.camera.disable();
await call.microphone.disable();

// and then join the call
await call.join();
```

### Leave call

To leave a call, you can use the `leave` method:

```typescript
await call.leave();
```

### End call

Ending a call requires a [special permission](../../guides/permissions-and-moderation). This action terminates the call for everyone.

```typescript
await call.endCall();
```

Only users with a special permission (`JoinEndedCall`) can join an ended call.

### Load call

Existing calls can be loaded through the following API:

```typescript
const call = client.call(type, id);
await call.get(); // just load

await call.getOrCreate(); // create if not present and load it
```

These operations initialize the `call.state` and create a subscription for call updates to our backend.
This means that this `call` instance will receive real-time updates in case it is modified somewhere else.

Read more about call state here: [Call & Participant State](../../guides/call-and-participant-state/).

### Update call

After creating a call, you can update some of its properties:

```typescript
import { RecordSettingsRequestModeEnum } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

await call.update({
  custom: { color: 'green' },
  settings_override: {
    recording: {
      mode: RecordSettingsRequestModeEnum.DISABLED,
    },
  },
});
```

## Call creation options

The following options are supported when creating a call:

| Option     | Description                                                                                                     | Default |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `members`  | A list of members to add to this call. You can specify the role and custom data on these members                | -       |
| `custom`   | Any custom data you want to store                                                                               | -       |
| `settings` | You can overwrite certain call settings for this specific call. This overwrites the call type standard settings | -       |
| `startsAt` | When the call will start. Used for calls scheduled in the future, livestreams, audio rooms etc                  | -       |
| `team`     | Restrict the access to this call to a specific team                                                             | -       |
| `ring`     | If you want the call to ring for each member                                                                    | `false` |
| `notify`   | If you want the call to nofiy each member by sending push notification.                                         | `false` |

### Set call members

```typescript
const call = client.call(type, id);
await call.getOrCreate({
  data: {
    members: [{ user_id: 'alice', role: 'admin' }, { user_id: 'bob' }],
  },
});
```

### Update call members

```typescript
await call.updateCallMembers({
  update_members: [{ user_id: 'charlie', role: 'admin' }],
  remove_members: ['alice'],
});
```

### Custom call data

```typescript
await call.getOrCreate({
  data: {
    custom: { color: 'blue' },
  },
});
```

### Settings override

By default, the `call` instances inherit the settings defined in the call type.
In some cases, you might want to override call settings on the instance itself:

```typescript
// at creation time
await call.getOrCreate({
  data: {
    settings_override: {
      audio: { mic_default_on: false },
      video: { camera_default_on: false },
    },
  },
});

// or later
await call.update({
  settings_override: {
    video: { camera_default_on: true },
  },
});
```

## Restricting access

You can restrict access to a call by tweaking the [Call Type](../../guides/configuring-call-types/) permissions and roles.
A typical use case is to restrict access to a call to a specific set of users -> call members.

#### Step 1: Set up the roles and permissions

On our [dashboard](https://dashboard.getstream.io/), navigate to the **Video & Audio -> Roles & Permissions** section and select the appropriate role and scope.
In this example, we will use `my-call-type` scope.

By default, all users unless specified otherwise, have the `user` role.

We start by removing the `JoinCall` permission from the `user` role for the `my-call-type` scope.
It will prevent regular users from joining a call of this type.

![Revoke JoinCall for user role](../assets/02-guides/02-joining-creating-calls/user-revoke-joincall.png)

Next, let's ensure that the `call_member` role has the `JoinCall` permission for the `my-call-type` scope.
It will allow users with the `call_member` role to join a call of this type.

![Grant JoinCall for call_member role](../assets/02-guides/02-joining-creating-calls/call_member-grant-joincall.png)

Once this is set, we can proceed with setting up a `call` instance.

#### Step 2: Set up the call

```typescript
const call = client.call('my-call-type', 'my-call-id');
await call.getOrCreate({
  data: {
    members: [
      // please note the `role` property
      { user_id: 'alice', role: 'call_member' },
      { user_id: 'bob', role: 'call_member' },
    ],
  },
});

// and if necessary, to grant access to more users
await call.updateCallMembers({
  update_members: [{ user_id: 'charlie', role: 'call_member' }],
});

// or, to remove access from some users
await call.updateCallMembers({
  remove_members: ['charlie'],
});
```
