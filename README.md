## Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies by running `yarn install` in the root of the repo
3. Generate the client `cd packages/client && yarn generate-client && yarn build`
4. Run the application `yarn start` (make sure the server is already running)

## Notes
Protobuf files are currently manually copied from the [GetStream/video](GetStream/video)
to `packages/client/protobuf`. The process will be automated soon.
